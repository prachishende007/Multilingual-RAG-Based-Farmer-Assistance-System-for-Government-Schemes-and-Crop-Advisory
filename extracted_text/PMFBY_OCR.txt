Objective of the Scheme

Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) aims at supporting sustainable production in agriculture
sector by way of

Providing financial support to farmers suffering crop loss/damage arising out of unforeseen events
Stabilizing the income of farmers to ensure their continuance in farming
Encouraging farmers to adopt innovative and modern agricultural practices

Ensuring flow of credit to the agriculture sector which will contribute to food security, crop
diversification and enhancing growth and competitiveness of agriculture sector besides protecting
farmers from production risks.

Adoption of Technology for Scheme Administration:

2.1

2.2

2.3

2.4

2.5

2.6

In an endeavour to integrate Technology in implementation and execution of the Scheme, the Govt. of
India has designed and developed a National Crop Insurance Portal (NCIP) (www. pmfby.gov.in). This
will bring in better administration and coordination amongst stakeholders viz. Farmers, States,
Insurers and Banks as well as real time dissemination of information and transparency.

The successful running of the Portal calls for responsible participation by different stakeholders who
will have the responsibility for census Coding and updating revenue/administrative units, AWS code
mapping and updating requisite information/details as per login credential module.

Implementing States and Insurance Companies during each crop season are required to digitize and
upload on the web Portal in the relevant module, basic information like notified areas, crops, sum
insured, Govt. subsidy, and premium to be paid by farmers and name of the implementing Insurance
Companies in the particular insurance unit etc., well within the prescribed time. This will facilitate
farmers and other stakeholders to get the relevant information on Internet and through SMS. State
Govt. and concerned Insurance Company will be responsible for any incorrect entry/ errors/ omissions
etc.

Digitization of basic information/notification should compulsorily be done before floating tender
documents which will be followed by entry of bidded Premium rates and name of selected Insurance
Company immediately after finalization of bids and issue of work order.

Since the National Crop Insurance Portal has been conceptualised for auto administration and
seamless flow of data/information/reports on real time basis, State Govt. would not be allowed to
create/use separate Portal/website for Crop Insurance purposes.

All Stakeholders have defined roles and responsibilities and accessibility to related modules on the
Portal for administration of the Scheme. Details of operationalization of modules for each
stakeholder are available on the Portal for ready reference.

Secured credential/login, preferably linked with Aadhaar Number and mobile OTP based, for all
Stakeholders viz, Central Government, State Governments, Banks, empanelled Insurance Companies
and their designated field functionaries will be provided on the Portal to enable them to
enter/upload/download the requisite information.

Insurance Companies shall not distribute/collect/allow any other proforma/utility/web Portal etc for
collecting details of insured farmers separately. However they may provide all requisite support to
facilitate Bank Branches/PACS for uploading the farmer's details on the Portal well within the
prescribed cut-off dates.

Only farmers whose data is uploaded on the National Crop Insurance Portal shall be eligible for
Insurance coverage and the premium subsidy from State and Central Govt. will be released
accordingly.

All data pertaining to crop-wise, area-wise historical yield data, weather data, sown area, coverage
and claims data, calamity years and actual yield shall be made available on the National Crop
Insurance Portal for the purpose of premium rating, claim calculation ete.

Banks/Financial Institutions/other intermediaries need to compulsorily transfer the individual farmer’s
data electronically to the National Crop Insurance Portal. Accordingly Banks/Fis may endeavour to
undertake CBS integration in a time bound manner for real time transfer of information/data.

It is also proposed to develop an integrated platform/portal for both PMFBY and Interest Subvention
Scheme. The data/information of both the Schemes shall be auto synchronized to enable real time
sharing of information and better program monitoring.

Insurance Companies shall compulsorily use technology/mobile applications for monitoring of crop
health/Crop Cutting Experiments (CCEs) in coordination with concerned States. States shall also
facilitate Insurance Companies with Satellite Imagery/Usage of Drones by way of prior approval of
agency from which such data can be sourced. This is required for better monitoring and ground-
truthing. ICs can be active partners in facilitating use of technology.

States shall adopt technology, such as satellite and UAV remote sensing, for various applications such
as crop area estimation and yield disputes and also promote the use of remote sensing and other
related technology for CCE planning, yield estimation, loss assessment, assessment of prevented
sowing and clustering of districts.

Coverage of Farmers

3.1

3.1.1.1

3.1.1.2

3.1.1.3

All farmers including sharecroppers and tenant farmers growing the notified crops in the notified areas
are eligible for coverage. However, farmers should have insurable interest for the notified/insured
crops. The non-loanee farmers are required to submit necessary documentary evidence of land
records prevailing in the State (Records of Right (RoR), Land possession Certificate (LPC) etc.) and/
or applicable contract/ agreement details/ other documents notified/ permitted by concerned State
Govt. in case of sharecroppers/tenant farmers and the same should be defined by the respective
States in the notification itself.

Compulsory Component

All farmers who have been sanctioned Seasonal Agricultural Operations (SAO) loans from Financial
Institutions (Fis) (i.e. loanee farmers) for the notified crop(s) season would be covered compulsorily.
This provision shall override any decision taken by Fis including PACS exempting farmers from
compulsory coverage of loanee farmers.

However non-standard KCC /crop loans as defined and as per prevailing practices of the concerned
Banks/Govt. regulator shall not be covered compulsorily. However bank branches may facilitate such
farmers for enrolment as non-loanee farmers .

Merely, sanctioning of crop loan against other collateral securities including fixed deposits, gold/jewel
loans, mortgage loans etc. without having insurable interest of the farmer on the insurable land and
notified crops shall not be covered under the Scheme.

Voluntary Component

The Scheme is optional for non-loanee farmers.

The insurance coverage will strictly be equivalent to sum insured/hectare, as defined in the Govt.
notification or /and on National Crop Insurance Portal multiplied by sown area for notified crop.

Special efforts shall be made to ensure maximum coverage of SC/ ST/ Women farmers under the
Scheme. Further Panchayat Raj Institutions (PRIs) may be involved in extension and awareness
creation amongst farmers and obtaining feed-back of farmers about the implementation of the
Scheme

The implementing Insurance Company selected as L1 will be responsible for taking necessary
measures to ensure at least 10% incremental increase in coverage of non-loanee farmers. However
other empanelled Insurance Companies which have participated in the bidding and are keen for
enrolment of non loanee farmers in the cluster may also be allowed to enrol non-loanee farmers at L1
premium rate. The interested companies have to inform their willingness in writing within seven days
of finalisation of tender/issuance of work order to L1. It will however be the responsibility of all the
Insurance Companies engaged in this process to ensure that duplicate enrolment does not happen in
the given cluster/district. Engaging companies other than L1 for enrolling non loanee farmers will be
taken up on a pilot basis in Districts notified by State Govt. They shall enrol non loanee farmers as per

www.pmfby.gov.in 3
Revised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY

conditions laid down in Para 17.5.

These Insurance Company will maintain separate data of such non loanee farmers covered by them
and enter the said data on the portal as per seasonality discipline detailed in Para 16.2. They shall be
liable for payment of claims to such farmers.

The exchange of information, co-witnessing of CCEs and sharing of yield data etc for the cluster by
Government/NCIP will be limited to L1 Company only and it will be binding on other companies to
accept it. However, the requisition for payment of Government subsidy in respect of non-loanee
enrolled by them will be submitted directly to the Govt designated agency.

Coverage of Crops

|. Food crops (Cereals ,Millets and Pulses),
ll. Oilseeds
Ill. Annual Commercial / Annual Horticultural crops.

In addition for perennial crops, pilots for coverage can be taken for those perennial horticultural crops
for which standard methodology for yield estimation is available.

Coverage of Risks and Exclusions

5.1

5.1.1

5.1.2

5.1.3

5.15

Following stages of the crop risks leading to crop loss are covered under the Scheme. Addition of new
risks by the State Govt other than the one mentioned below, by the State Govt. is not permitted.

Prevented Sowing/Planting/Germination Risk: Insured area is prevented from sowing/
planting/germination due to deficit rainfall or adverse seasonal/weather conditions.

Standing Crop (Sowing to Harvesting): Comprehensive risk insurance is provided to cover yield losses
due to non-preventable risks, viz. Drought, Dry spell, Flood, Inundation, widespread Pests and Disease
attack, Landslides, Fire due to natural causes ,Lightening, Storm, Hailstorm and Cyclone.

Post-Harvest Losses: Coverage is available only upto a maximum period of two weeks from harvesting,
for those crops which are required to be dried in cut and spread / small bundled condition in the field
after harvesting against specific perils of Hailstorm, Cyclone,Cyclonic rains and Unseasonal rains.

Localized Calamities: Loss/damage to notified insured crops resulting from occurrence of identified
localized risks of Hailstorm, Landslide, Inundation, Cloud burst and Natural fire due to lightening
affecting isolated farms in the notified area.

Add-on coverage for crop loss due to attack by wild animals: The States may consider providing
add-on coverage for crop loss due to attack by wild animals wherever the risk is perceived to be
substantial and is identifiable. Detailed protocol and procedure for evaluation of bids will be
issued separately by GOI in consultation with Ministry of Environment and Forest and GIC Re. The

add-on coverage will be optional for the farmers and applicable notional premium will be borne by the

www.pmfby.gov.in 4
Revised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY

farmer, however the State Govts may consider providing additional subsidy on this coverage,
wherever notified. The actuarial premium rates for add-on coverage should be sought in the bid
itself from the Insurance Companies, however the add-on actuarial premium rate will be
considered separately and shall not form part of evaluation of L1.

General Exclusions: Losses arising out of war and nuclear risks, malicious damage and other
preventable risks shall be excluded.

State Govts./UTs ,in consultation with SLCCCI, can exclude any of the aforesaid perils listed above
which is not prevailing in their State/UT

Yield loss damage for localised calamities and post harvest losses will be assessed on the basis of
individual insured farm level and hence lodging of loss information by farmer/designated agencies
is essential. For remaining risks losses are due to widespread calamities. Hence lodging of
information for claims by insured farmers / designated agencies for such wise spread calamities is
not essential. Claims will be calculated based on the loss assessment report/average yield
submitted by concerned State Govt.

Preconditions for implementation of the Scheme

6.1

6.1.4

States:

Issuance of Notification by State Govt. / UT for implementation of the Scheme (PMFBY) will imply
their acceptance of all provisions, modalities and guidelines of the Scheme. The main conditions
relating to PMFBY which are binding on States/UTs are as follows:

Adoption of innovative technology especially Smart phones/ hand held devices for capturing conduct
of CCEs through CCE-Agri App and use of NCIP platform for flow of information and auto
administration of the scheme

State has to conduct requisite number of Crop Cutting Experiments (CCEs) at the level of notified
insurance unit area;

CCE based yield data will be uploaded on the National Crop Insurance Portal/submitted to Insurance
Company within the notified cut off date ;

State/ UT will make necessary budgetary provision for premium subsidy based on fair estimates, at
the beginning of the crop season;

To carry out pilot studies for improved yield estimations using technology.

Department of State Govt. which was earlier looking after implementation of erstwhile National
Agriculture Insurance Scheme (NAIS)/ National Crop Insurance Programme (NCIP*) may be designated
as Nodal Department for implementation of PMFBY. The State Level Coordination Committee on Crop
Insurance (SLCCCI) which was overseeing implementation of NAIS and NCIP* may be authorized to
oversee implementation of PMFBY. The States/UTs which had not implemented the NAIS / NCIP* shall

constitute SLCCCI for implementation of PMFBY on the lines similar to that of NAIS/NCIP*. The present
composition of SLCCCI may be strengthened by including representatives from State Horticulture
Dept., State Remote Sensing Application Centre, India Meteorological Department (IMD), Farmers’
Representatives and empanelled Insurance Companies for implementing PMFBY. Chairman of SLCCCI
may co-opt representatives from other departments/agencies, if considered necessary.

Insurance Company:

Empanelment of Insurance Companies and their participation for implementation of the Scheme
(PMFBY) will imply their acceptance of all provisions, modalities and guidelines of the Scheme. The
empanelled Insurance Companies have to deploy requisite infrastructure and resources for
implementation of PMFBY particularly for following identified major activities:

To carry out Pilot study for leveraging new technology for effective implementation of Scheme in a
transparent manner,

Deployment of requisite infrastructure to increase the outreach to rural farmers at their doorstep,
Commitment for at least 10 % incremental increase in Non loanee coverage,

Deployment of sufficient manpower to co-observe CCEs and allied activities and compulsory use of
CCE Co-observation app,

Allocation of requisite resources and commitment for advertisements, awareness generation and
capacity building of stakeholders about the Scheme. The detailed planning for the same should be
submitted to Central and State Govt. in advance, before the start of each season.

Submission of UID (AADHAAR) by farmer:

Aadhaar has been made mandatory for availing Crop insurance from Kharif 2017 season onwards.
Therefore, all banks are advised to mandatorily obtain Aadhaar number of their farmers and the same
applies for mnon-loanee farmers enrolled through banks/Insurance companies/insurance
intermediaries.

Farmers not having Aadhaar ID may also enrol under PMFBY subject to their enrolment for
Aadhaar and submission of proof of such enrolment as per notification No. 334.dated 8th February,
2017 issued by GOI under Section 7 of Aadhaar Act 2016(Targeted Delivery of Financial and other
Subsidies, Benefits and Services). Copy of the notification may be perused on www.pmfby.gov.in. This
may be subject to further directions issued by Govt. from time to time.

All banks have to compulsorily take Aadhaar/Aadhaar enrolment number as per notification
Aadhaar Act before sanction of crop loan/KCC under Interest Subvention Scheme. Hence the coverage
of loanee farmers without Aadhaar does not arise and such accounts need to be reviewed by the
concerned bank branch regularly.

Notification

7.1.4

Procedure for Issuance of Notification by the States/UTs:

Prior to the commencement of the Kharif season, preferably in the beginning of November of previous
year, meeting of SLCCCI should be convened for finalising various terms and conditions and calling of
bids/issuance of the bid notice to all empanelled Insurance Companies for selection to implement the
Scheme during the bid/ risk period. State / UT Govt. should ensure the issuance of the notification and
its circulation to all concerned agencies/ departments/ institutions at least one month in advance of
the commencement of the crop season incorporating all the essential details about insured crops,
areas, Scale of Finance, Sum Insured, Threshold Yield at insurance unit (IU) level for notified crops,
period of contract, bidder’s evaluation and selection methodology, premium rate for farmers, Govt.
subsidy along with seasonality discipline/ cut off date for each activity etc. Notification should be
issued for at least one year to facilitate banks for deduction of premium for a year

In order to have transparency and system driven approach for crop insurance implementation, all the
details as mentioned in para 7.1.1 above need to be part of the Tender Document and State
Notification and no modification in the terms and condition enumerated in the tender document shall
be allowed post tendering.

Bidding annexures may be generated, through Portal. Procedure and template are available on
National Crop Insurance Portal. Before, floating the Tender, last 10 years yield data at
notified/available level and TY at notifiedunit should be uploaded on the Portal in the given template
and should be made part of the Tender.

Calculation of lowest weighted premium of district shall be based on the insured areas of notified
crops in each district during last year/season. However, in absence of insured area of last year/season
for all proposed crops or any crop, net sown area of that crop(s) will be considered for calculation of
weighted premium of district. This data will be used for calculation of L1 only.

Bidding shall be done through e-tendering and work order may be released within 2 weeks of the
opening of the Tender.

Depending on the risk profile, historical loss cost and cost benefit analysis for the proposed crop(s) in
district(s) of any cluster, if the State Government feels that the premium rate likely to be offered by
bidding Insurance Companies would be abnormally high, then the State Govt. can fix a ceiling on
premium rates for such crop(s) proposed to be included in the bidding evaluation for the bidding
period. However, recourse to this ceiling provision may be done only in well justified cases and not as
a general practice. The ceiling premium rate may be derived based on statistical evaluation/actuarial
premium analysis, loss cost, historical payout etc and name of such crop should be disclosed by State
Govt. compulsorily in the tender document.

In such cases where a ceiling has been indicated, State government must call financial bids in two step
bidding or in two separate envelopes. First bid/envelop is for disclosing the premium rate offered by
each participating Insurance Company for such ceiling crops and must be categorised under “Ceiling

Revised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY

7.1.10

7.1.11

7.1.12

7.2
7.21

Premium Rate” and 2” bid envelop is for bidding of crop wise premium rate for all crops included in
tender. Time interval for opening of both bid/envelop should be compulsorily mentioned in the
bidding documents and should preferably be on the same day. All participating Insurance Companies
have to submit the bid offer as per the procedure mentioned above.

State Govt. shall first evaluate first envelop of the bid keeping in view the premium offered by each
individual participating Insurance company and if the risk propensity and weather susceptibility of the
crop and/or historical claim/loss data doesn’t support the actuarial rates offered by the participating
Insurance Companies, such crop(s) may be dropped from the list of proposed crops for notification by
the State Government and evaluation for L1 bidder should be done strictly based on the rates offered
for left out/remaining crops. The second envelope shall be opened by the State Govt. only after
decision on dropping the proposed crops/or accepting the premium rates offered by participating
Insurance companies has been taken by:the State Govt. If State Govt decides not to drop all proposed
crop(s)/ few crops for which premium rate obtained in separate envelop of “Ceiling Premium Rate”
from the bidding process, then L1 will be calculated by inclusion of premium offered for all
crops/remaining crops.

States should avoid doing re-tendering.as a general practice. Re-tendering may be held only in
exceptional circumstances and only with the prior approval of GOI after submission of a request with
detailed reasons. GOI on its part will give its decision within 5 working days of the receipt of the
request.

States are required to compulsorily upload Meeting Notices, Tender Documents, Addendums,
requisite data and other relevant information on the National Crop Insurance Portal for faster
communication and response. Accordingly the subsequent notifications, circulars, directives shall also
be uploaded on the Portal as and when issued for wider reach and circulation.

All conditions proposed to be stipulated by State Govt. should be incorporated in bid document itself
and no new condition should be included in the notification. In case ICs have any objection to any
Tender condition which is in conflict with guidelines, they can make a reference to State govt. with a
copy to GOI within 3 days of issuance of Tender

L1 bidder will not be allowed to withdraw their bid after opening of bids/allotment of work. If L1
bidder withdraws then financial loss, if any, to the State Govt. due to retendering /assignment of
work to others, due to increase in actuarial premium rate from previously declared L1 rate, shall be
recovered from the withdrawing L1 bidder.

Notification of Crops, Areas and Implementing Agency (IA)

The Scheme shall operate on the principle of “Area Approach” in the selected defined areas called
Insurance Unit (IU). State Govt. /UT will notify crops and defined areas covered during the season in
accordance with decision taken in the meeting of SLCCCI. State/UT Govt. should notify Village/Village
Panchayat or any other equivalent unit as an insurance unit for major crops defined at District /
Taluka or equivalent level. For other crops it may be a unit of size above the level of Village/village
Panchayat. For defining a crop as a major crop for deciding the Insurance Unit level, the sown area of

7.2.8

that crop should be at least 25% of Gross Cropped Area in a District/ Taluka or equivalent level

For the claims arising out of crop damage due to post-harvest losses and localized risks, assessment of
damage will be made on individual farm basis as outlined in (Section 21, para 21.4 and 21.5
respectively).

SLCCCI will, for the purpose of notification, consider factors such as availability of past yield data based
on CCEs for adequate number of years (at least 7 years for calculation of threshold yield), cropped
acreage and capacity for estimating yield during proposed season, etc. State govt. should endeavour to
cover all the major crops grown in all the districts of the State. States should ensure that a standard
methodology of yield estimation exists for all the crops proposed to be notified

State Govt./ UT should provide 10 years’ historical yield data in soft format(in Excel) in English to
Insurance Companies for calculation of threshold yield , premium rates etc. at insurance unit area
and in its absence, data at next higher unit/nearest neighbouring unit/weighted average of contiguous
units, as decided by the SLCCCI shall be used. The level and name of notified area of insurance unit
must be part of notification and should be provided at the time of bidding itself.

In case State Govts/UT proposes to notify irrigated and un-irrigated areas under a crop separately,
they shall ensure that minimum CCEs are planned and conducted for irrigated and un-irrigated crops
separately in such areas. In addition, past yield data for requisite number of years will have to be made
available separately for both

While notifying the crop(s) where a specific conversion factor is being used for reporting of yield such
as in the case of rice/paddy etc, due care should be taken by the State Nodal Department to use the
relevant specific nomenclature for disclosure of Average Yield, Threshold Yield and Actual Yield while
releasing the Tender Document and submission of Yield data and CCE data for calculation of admissible
claims. Insurance Companies will also be responsible for prior scrutiny of Tender document.
Information/data provided in Tender document will be treated as final and in case of any error/
misreporting/disparity, State Govt. and Insurance Company will be equally liable for payment of
additional claims arising on account of it, if any.

For the current season or subsequent seasons (in a multi-year contract), the States, if required, can
notify additional |Us or de-notify certain |Us subject to maximum deviation of 10% of already notified
Us for the crop within a district at the same premium rate, before the cut-off date for debit of
premium. If the deviation is >10% or in case of addition of new crop, actuarial premium rate may be
worked out either by calculation of weighted average premium rate as prevalent in contiguous
districts or by applying appropriate loading on the existing premium rate. The rates for such crops will
be determined /verified by TSU and its decision will be binding on both States and ICs.

States implementing PMFBY at Village/ Village Panchayat level for major crops shall be entitled for
50% reimbursement of incremental expenses of CCEs and cost of smart phones/ improved
technology from GOI. Only eligible items will be considered for reimbursement. The data source for
calculation of admissibility of incremental CCEs will be the National Crop Insurance Portal.

Notification of Indemnity Level, Average Yield and Threshold Yield

Three levels of Indemnity, viz., 70%, 80% and 90%. SLCCCI in consultation with Insurance Companies
shall approve indemnity levels for notified crops at district level. Threshold Yield (TY) shall be notified
in the Tender for the current season and the same will be used for claim calculation for that season.
The Average Yield of a notified crop in Insurance Unit (IU) will be average yield of best five years out of
last seven years. The Threshold yield of the notified crop is equal to Average Yield multiplied by
Indemnity level. The Threshold Yield for any crop and IU shall compulsorily be part of the notification
for the season and shall not change at any point during that season.

Calculation and Notification of Threshold Yield: For calculation of Threshold Yield, historical average
yield of best five out of last seven years shall be considered. Further Threshold Yield should be defined
only at notified area level and once notified in the Notification issued by the State should not be
changed at later stage under any circumstances. In case of multi-year contract, the Threshold Yield for
the subsequent years shall be revised by adding/considering the yields of immediate previous
corresponding season. The revised TY and Sum Insured (if revised) should be notified accordingly at
the beginning of each crop season in case of multi-year tender.

Notification of Seasonality discipline:

State Govt./ UT in accordance with the broad seasonality defined/prescribed in the Operational
Guidelines shall also notify seasonality discipline for various activities under the Scheme viz.

calamities, (iii) prevented sowing, iv) post harvest losses, (v) On-Account payment for major calamities,
etc as per the provisions of the Scheme.

*In exceptional cases, where last corresponding season yield data is not available at the time of
Bidding/Notification, yield data is to be provided before the harvesting of the current season. However
the yield data upto last to last corresponding season should be provided at the time of bidding itself.
However, in such cases admissible claims will be anyway calculated on the basis of yield data of last 7
years only.

Notification of Automatic Weather Stations (AWS)

Only those AWS/ARGs of IMD/State Govt. /private agencies should be considered and notified which
are as per standards defined by IMD/WMO and are certified and approved by IMD/any agency to be
notified by the State/Central govt. These must be optimally operational and be able to provide real
time weather data. AWS/ARG of private agencies should only be considered in absence of properly
functioning AWS/ARGs of IMD/ State Govt. AWS /ARG data sourced for crop insurance should be
transferred on real time basis to National Portal. The detailed guidelines for sharing of weather data
on the Portal will be circulated separately.

State govt can explore the possibility to create dense AWS/ARG network on PPP Mode for which GOI
will provide 50% of the viability gap funding.

15.3

15.4

National Technical Support Unit (NTSU) or Central Program Management Unit (CPMU) will be created
at the Central level at the earliest to provide support and advise on risk classification & rating,
development of new products, methodology for loss assessment, legal works, workshop/training &
capacity building, alongwith use of technology including innovation/ replication, digitisation of
administration of Schemes through Crop Insurance Portal etc.

NTSU shall calculate Loss Cost (LC) i.e. Claims as percentage (%) of Sum Insured (SI) observed in case of
notified crop(s) in notified unit area of insurance during the preceding 10 similar crop seasons (Kharif/
Rabi) along with approximate actuarial premium rate of the crops proposed to be notified for the
season. This loss cost/premium rate shall be based on the latest available yield data in month of
January for Kharif crops and July for Rabi crops and shall be provided to DAC & FW/ Concerned States
on request before invitation for premium bidding. This calculation to be done by NTSU on behalf of
DAC & FW is only for official purposes to have information on the approximate cost to the IA for
covering the risks so as to evaluate the bids in proper perspective.

National Technical Support Unit (NTSU) may also develop a suitable methodology for risk
classification/premium rating by using historical yield data, weather data, use and level of
inputs/irrigation/technology in crop Cultivation, remote sensing data/information etc. for
standardization of methodology for risk perception and premium rating for crop insurance in the
country.

In addition to National Technical Support Unit (NTSU) / Central Programme Management Unit (CPMU)
at Central level, all States/UTs implementing Schemes should also create a separate TSU/PMU at State
HQ level with sufficient technical experts/staff to ensure proper implementation of the Scheme. State
TSU (STSU) may also opt for members on contractual/temporary basis or take services of other
organizations/research institutes etc as deemed fit. However, States shall have to allocate a separate
budget for running the STSU.

date (renew/sanction period) for the season will be eligible for cover under crop insurance for the
next/following crop season subject to the loan being standard loan and cut-off-date of premium debit
for the season. In order to eliminate excess insurance and subsequent application of Area Correction
Factor(ACF), care should be taken by the banks to ensure that only correct acreage under each
declared crop in loan application is considered for compulsory coverage of notified crop and not the
actual total acreage,. Banks will be liable for audit and inspection on account of excess Insurance/ACF.

17.4.3 Benefit of add on products viz., prevented sowing/ on account payment for Mid season adversity/
localized calamity will be available to only those farmers who have paid the premium / the premium
has been debited from their account before the damage notification by the State Govt. for invoking
this provision for compensation. Hence, Banks must ensure that they debit farmers premium within 15
days from sanction/renewal of KCC/crop loan, failing which banks will be liable to meet the claim
liabilities of uncovered eligible famers. Banks are therefore advised to debit loanee farmers premium
at least one month before cut-off date for enrolment to avoid this situation and in case sanction
happens within one month of cut-off date, banks maydaily debit premium for such accounts.

17.4.5 Crop loans sanctioned through Kisan Credit Cards (KCC) are covered under compulsory coverage and
banks shall maintain all back up records and registers relating to compliance with PMFBY and its
seasonality discipline and cut-off-date for remittance of premium/ submitting of coverage details as in
the case of normal crop loans. Bank branch will apportion coverage among insurable crops, based on
acreage mentioned in loan application or.on the basis of actual area sown as declared by the farmer
subsequently.

17.4.6 Bank branches of Commercial banks and RRBs/ Nodal Bank in case of PACS under its jurisdiction shall
submit individual insured farmer's details along with NEFT/RTGS/UTR details of premium online
through National Crop Insurance (Portal. Additionally, consolidated insurance proposals/
statements/declarations from the bank branch/ Nodal Bank in case of PACS under its jurisdiction,
shall be forwarded to the concerned Insurance Company along with details of remittance/ RTGS
towards insurance premium, in accordance with cut off dates, as specified by SLCCCI for a particular
crop and season. It shall be the responsibility of ICs to collect the consolidated statement from the
concerned bank branches/ PACS.

17.4.7 Different options are available for bank branches to provide details of beneficiaries in a more
transparent and authentic mechanism. Bank branch can upload the details of insured farmers through
online application mode. Banks are required to upload/enter the information continuously without
waiting for last day for premium debit and data entry.

17.48 As an alternative, direct integration of Core Banking Solution (CBS) with National Crop Insurance Portal
has also been successfully initiated and the same may be used by Scheduled Commercial
Banks/RRBs/DCCBs available on CBS for pushing the farmers’ details in bulk directly without filling the
individual farmer's details on web-portal or off-line utility.

17.5 Non-loanee farmers (Optional coverage) through other channel partners

17.5.1 Farmers desirous of availing insurance shall fill up Application Form of the Scheme and submit the
same to nearest bank branch/CSCs or authorized channel partner or insurance intermediaries of
insurance company.

17.5.6

In case of submission through Bank Branches, farmers will submit duly filled proposal form in the
nearest branch of aCommercial Bank (CB) or Regional Rural Bank (RRB), or PACS (DCCB) with applicable
insurance premium amount and other documents. Bank Branch may, after completing verification of
documents, accept or reject the application. Premium is accepted by the bank branch preferably from
the farmer's operational account in the same bank branch itself and the same would be sent to the
concerned Insurance Company within the stipulated time for the purpose. It is the responsibility of
bank branch to complete the application of farmer. In case the farmers is unable to fill the
application, bank branch is responsible for filling the application on farmer’s behalf, so that not a
single farmer who desires to take crop insurance coverage is left out from the purview of crop
insurance Scheme

In case submitted through CSCs, farmer will be required to authenticate herself/himself using Aadhaar
for filling up online application form. Having a bank account is essential for such cases. CSC will upload
all requisite/desired supporting documents on Portal while filling up the application form on behalf of
the farmer. Applications without requisite documents would not be considered for insurance coverage
and CSC-VLE is responsible for proper filling of application form.

CSC/Branch/ PACS officials will assist the farmers in completing the insurance proposal form and
provide necessary guidance. While accepting the applications and premium, CSC/Branch/ PACS will be
responsible for verification of required documents, eligible sum insured, applicable premium rate, etc.
In case of coverage through PACS, they will consolidate these particulars and send them directly/ to
respective Nodal Bank Branches which will, in turn, submit application details online on National Crop
Insurance Portal and submit crop-wise and insurance unit-wise declarations electronically in the
prescribed format, along with the e-remittance of premium using payment gateway/ RTGS/NEFT
mode, within the stipulated time, to insurance company. Besides CSCs, other Govt./ semi-Govt.
institutions/organizations including Post offices are also proposed to be utilized for insurance of non-
loanee farmers after their integration with the National Crop Insurance Portal after obtaining
approval of competent authorities.

Non-loanee cultivators could also be serviced directly by any designated agencies, other authorized
channel partners or insurance intermediaries, approved by the IRDA for the purpose and they will act
as a guide and facilitator wherein they will advise such non loanee cultivators about the benefits and
desirability of the Scheme and guide the farmers about procedures; collect requisite premium and
remit individual/ consolidated premium electronically to insurance company, accompanied by individual
proposal forms and summary details in declaration form and upload details of each insured
farmer compulsorily within stipulated timelines on the NCIP.

While accepting the Proposal and the premium from aforesaid designated agents, other authorized
channel partner or insurance intermediaries approved by IRDA, it shall be the responsibility of
Insurance Company or its designated agents to verify insurable interest and collect the land records,
Aadhaar Number., particulars of acreage, sum insured, crop sown etc. and applicable contract/
agreement details in case of share croppers/ tenant farmers. The designated intermediaries shall enter
the data of farmers on web-portal, remit the premium with consolidated proposals within 2 days.
However, it is mandatory that the non-loanee cultivators serviced by the designated intermediaries
should hold a bank account and Aadhaar No. or Aadhaar enrolment No. in order to get insured and the

designated intermediaries will also facilitate remittance of the claim, if payable.

For farmers buying crop insurance through CSCs or online, OTP/Aadhaar enabled verification shall be
construed as signature by the applicant for coverage under crop insurance

Non-loanee Farmers (Optional coverage) - directly to Insurance Companies/Web Portal

Non-Loanee farmer may submit insurance proposals personally - to Insurance Company with
requisite/desired supporting documents and applicable premium has to be remitted electronically to
concerned Insurance Company and details of UTR/remittance slips should compulsorily be attached
with application. .

Non-loanee farmers can also submit application forms for getting insurance coverage through web-Portal.
For this, farmer can fill up the online application form available on crop insurance Portal
(www.pmfby.gov.in) and pay the requisite premium through payment gateway. As soon as the
application is submitted through the system, an acknowledgement receipt will be generated along with
a unique identification number. Additionally, intimation will also be sent through SMS on registered
mobile number of the farmer.

However, it is mandatory that Non-Loanee farmers, personally submitting proposals to Insurance
Company or through National Crop Insurance Portal, should have insurable interest and submit
necessary documentary evidence as proof\as decided by SLCCCI along with Aadhaar no. or Aadhaar
enrolment No. . The insured farmer losesthe premium and the right to claim (if any) if the material facts
furnished in the proposal form are found to be wrong or incorrect at any subsequent point in time.
Insurance companies retain the right to accept or reject insurance proposal(s) within 15 days/one
month of receipt of proposal for Loanee/Non loanee respectively, in case proposal is incomplete, not
accompanied by necessary documentary proof, Aadhaar no. or Aadhaar enrolment No./Slip or insurance
premium ordinarily,. If the proposal is rejected, the Insurance Company will fully refund the collected
premium.

Option for change of crop name

Farmers covered, on voluntary basis, can buy insurance before actual sowing/ planting, based on
advance crop planning. However, for any reason if a farmer changes the crop planned earlier, he
should intimate the change to insurance company, up to 2 working days before the cut-off-date for
enrolment/buying insurance, through financial _institution/channel _partner/ _ insurance
intermediary/directly as the case may be, along with difference in premium payable, if any,
accompanied with sowing certificate issued by concerned village/ sub-district level official of the State.
In case the premium paid was higher, Insurance Company will refund the excess premium.

Similarly, loanee farmers can also change the name of insured crop from the original crop indicated in
the loan application but such change should be submitted in writing to the concerned bank branch up
to 2 working days before cut-off date for enrolment and accordingly their newly proposed crop should
be insured. However change of non-notified crop to notified crops without submitting the sowing
certificate is not permissible. Bank will ensure that all standard loans (as defined by concerned
financial institutions) sanctioned/renewed for notified crops within stipulated cut-off date should
compulsorily be covered.

Declarations/ proposals and debited premium received by Insurance Companies from the Banks/
PACS after the cut-off date shall be summarily rejected and the liability, if any, for such declarations
shall rest with the concerned bank. Accordingly the data/proposal entry on the National Crop
Insurance Portal will also be stopped after the applicable cut off date. However, any dispute in the
matter may be resolved as per the Grievance redressal mechanism detailed in Section 30.

The concerned branches of banks and Nodal Banks/ DCCBs in case of PACS will upload the details of
individual insured farmers (both loanee and non-loanee) like farmer's name, father’s name, Bank
Account number, Aadhaar Number, village, categories — Small and Marginal/SC/ST/Women, insured
acreage, details of insured land, insured crop(s) etc as prescribed in online application form. available
on National Crop Insurance Portal or CBS integration module and submit the same within stipulated
cut-off date as per the seasonality discipline/ The Banks/ PACS must also ensure the premium amount
is remitted to the concerned Insurance Company electronically within the stipulated time, failing
which they shall be responsible for payment of claims, if any to the farmers. However, any dispute in
the matter may be referred to the State Govt. by the concerned Agency/Bank for taking appropriate
action within the prescribed cut off date for reconciliation of premium by banks with all details.

Insurance companies shall upload requisite information including necessary documentation in respect
of non-loanee farmers enrolled through channelypartner other than CSCs on the National Crop
Insurance Portal within the stipulated date of coverage of non loanee farmers .All intermediaries shall
ensure that the documentation is complete in all respect before accepting the premium. It is the
responsibility of the concerned Insurance Companies to collect/obtain any documentation of the
insured farmers (both loanee and non-loanee) from the bank/financial institutions/ intermediaries/
agents if necessary for verification/acceptance of risk and also to facilitate the banks/ financial
institutions/ intermediaries/ agents to submit/ upload all requisite documents/information on the
National Crop Insurance Portal within timelines.

Insurance Companies should also reconcile the details of individual insured farmers uploaded on the
Portal with the premium/consolidated declaration received from each branch/nodal bank within the
stipulated date and any deficiency/ mismatch may be reported to concerned bank branch/nodal bank.
The Bank Branch/Nodal Bank should further send/upload the requisite information in respect of such
farmers for whom clarification has been sought, immediately within 7 days. If such rectification is not
done/completed by bank branch /nodal bank within the stipulated period, Insurance Companies may
recommend to take necessary action to State Govt. under intimation to Central Govt. State Govt. in
consultation with SLBC may recommend suitable administrative action against such defaulting
branch/bank. However, claims (if any) in such cases of such farmers shall be borne by the concerned
bank only.

Insurance Companies should verify and satisfy themselves about the coverage of farmers/ crops and
give acceptance to the applications submitted by banks electronically through National Crop Insurance
Portal. The insured farmer's personal details like AADHAAR numbers, Banking Details, Address, mobile
nos. and all such details prohibited under RBI, IRDA or UIDAI Act. shall not be displayed/disclosed
publicly. Insurance Companies will reconcile the details along with farmer's share of premium receipt
before approaching the Govt. to release the final instalment of subsidy (third Instalment) under the
Scheme.

All Insurance Companies will compulsorily verify and take necessary action including
approval/rejection of proposal or policy of any farmer through National Crop Insurance Portal within
stipulated date. After stipulated period for reconciliation & obtaining further clarification from
stakeholders, all pending proposals/information of insured/covered farmers uploaded on Crop
Insurance Portal will be treated as approved and Insurance Companies will cease their right for any
further verification. However, any losses to the Govt. including excess payment of premium subsidy
due to delayed/non- verification of data/information of individual covered/insured farmers on crop
insurance Portal will be recovered from concerned Insurance Companies only.

Banks will ensure distribution of Acknowledgement Receipt along with Folio to each insured farmer

within 7 days from the acceptance of applications by the concerned insurance company. The
Acknowledgement Receipt will be generated through National Crop Insurance Portal itself.

Wide Spread Calamities (based on season-end yield): The Scheme operates on the basis of ‘Area
Approach’ i.e., Defined Areas for each notified crop for widespread calamities and insurance unit is
Village/Village Panchayat or any other equivalent unit for major crops and for other crops it may be
the same unit or a unit of size higher than Village/ Village Panchayat level, to be decided by the State/
UT Govt.. State Govt. Department overseeing conduct of CCEs will submit yield data as per cut-off date
decided by SLCCCI, along with results of individual CCEs (conducted through smart phone using CCE
Agri App) on National Crop Insurance Portal. Yield data so arrived at will be approved/ uploaded by
the concerned authority/State nodal department and made available to Insurance Company.

CCEs shall be undertaken per crop per unit area of insurance for notified crops*,on a sliding scale, as
indicated in Table 4 below:

Level Minimum sample size

District 24

Taluka/Tehsil/Block
Mandal/Firka/Revenue Circle/Hobli or any other equivalent unit
4 | Village/Village Panchayat 4

* Minor crops may be notified at higher than Village/Village Panchayat level.

In order to maintain the sanctity and credibility of CCEs as an objective method of yield estimation, the
modalities mentioned below will be followed:

To bring better transparency and confidence in the data, States shall mandatorily ensure 100% CCEs
through a mobile application specially designed by Govt. of India for this purpose. No other application
shall be used for conducting CCEs. CCE plots for conducting CCEs shall be chosen through random
selection or preferably using RST and secrecy of the selected plot should be maintained until the CCE
is actually conducted in order to rule out moral hazards.

In order to provide proper benefits to the farmers and to compensate them as per near actual loss
experience, crop should be notified at lowest level i.e. Village/Village Panchayat

State shall strengthen audit process of conduct of CCEs, with necessary checks and balances. Digitizing
the CCE process including geo-coding (providing the latitude and longitude of the CCE location), date/
time- stamping and taking photographs (of the CCE plot and CCE activity), is a must for all CCEs(para
20.4)

Wherever external agencies are proposed to be used by the State Govts. for conduct of CCEs (i.e. CCEs
are out-sourced), it should be given only to the registered ‘professional/accredited’ agencies with
adequate experience in agricultural field activities/yield estimation. It is mandatory for these agencies
to follow the digital protocol as mentioned in the previous paragraph. Services of such agencies may
also be utilized for assessment of Post-harvest loss and losses due to localized risks.

States shall maintain same procedure and methodology for conducting CCEs as adopted by NSSO or

State Manual for Crop Production estimation

District level Steering Committee: State Govt shall compulsorily constitute a Steering committee in
each district to plan, conduct and supervise the CCEs for yield assessment and to provide reports of
yield data to the State Nodal department. The Steering committee should be headed by District level
Head of Department/Organisation responsible for conducting CCEs. District Agriculture/Cooperative
officers, representatives of SSO and Insurance Companies shall be members. The Steering committee
will compulsorily associate the representatives of Insurance Companies so that they shall be well
informed about each and every activity and obtain the requisite information about CCE planning,
schedule for conducting CCEs, selection of CCEs plot, sharing of requisite form 2, form 8 etc. and
individual CCE result etc. Head of Steering Committee wil be responsible for uploading of all requisite
information on National Crop Insurance Portal i.e. CCE schedule, individual CCE report etc. and
imparting training to field functionaries responsible for conducting CCEs. Steering Committee will
compulsorily send all their proceedings / minutes etc to DLMC and Nodal officer of the State.
Concerned Insurance Companies shall compulsorily deploy one well conversant official at the office of
head of Steering Committee for at least 3 months of the harvesting period for better coordination and
obtaining the information of CCEs etc. District Administration will provide requisite space and logistics
at the office for the insurance company official.

In instances where required number of CCEs could not be conducted due to non-availability of
adequate cropped area, adverse weather conditions/inadequate infrastructure etc. the yield estimate
for such IUs can be generated by using methods such as (i) adopting yield estimate of next higher unit,
or (ii) adopting the yield of a neighbouring 1U with maximum correlation. Priority of applicability of
aforesaid two methods should be notified by the concerned States in the notification itself, failing
which option of yield estimate of next higher unit only would be considered. However, this clause shall
only be applicable in unavoidable situations and shall be limited to only minimal number of IU units
and cannot be made a general rule to avoid CCEs. Special efforts should be made by the State to
conduct adequate no. CCEs in all notified units in order to provide appropriate benefits to farmers.

In case of multi-picking crops e.g. Cotton, Chilly, Tobacco, Tomato, Pea, Fruits (Mango & Apples) &
other crops of similar nature, following procedure shall be followed.

State needs to, in the beginning; specify the number of required picking for each crop both for
irrigated and un-irrigated conditions. Ideally it should be as per NSSO/IASRI defined guidelines, if it is
not available, State in consultation with local Agriculture Universities and concerned ICAR center may
identify the required number of pickings. However number of actual picking depends on climatic
conditions etc. Hence possibility of further pickings of each picking should compulsorily be recorded in
CCE app and no. of actual picking will be final in such cases.

If the required number of CCEs have been done and the required number of picking have not being
done, then for those experiments, factors need to be used to extrapolate yield to the final yield.

The factors (proportion of picking wise yield) need to be computed from well conducted CCEs (with
the required number of pickings) from the same Taluka separately from Irrigated and Un-irrigated
condition. At least data of 5 well conducted CCE should be used for computing the factors.

An Example for Yield Calculation for multi-picking crop is mentioned in Table 5 below:

Crop Experiment no. Total Yield Kg)

P1,P2,P3,P4

Cotton

Cotton

Average

Factor (Total yield/
Picking Yield)

Cotton E6 (only 1* Picking) 6.373*

E7 (1% and 2™ Picking)

Cotton 5.795*

* Total yield has been calculated.as the sum of the available picking yields multiplied by
the corresponding factor

In cases there is dispute regarding the large deviation in picking dates the average picking dates should
be computed from well conducted CCEs in Taluka level. Accordingly the picking dates and number will
be adjusted. For example, if the average picking date for second picking in a particular Taluka is in
December and one experiment has shown first picking in December it will be considered as second
picking.

If there is no proper CCE (with required number of pickings) in the Taluka level even, it should be
considered as no CCE being available and the procedure defined in yield dispute SOP (Standard
Operating Procedure) should be followed, i.e. yield should be estimated using remote sensing and
weather based models. In case the crop has withered and there is no further possibility of having
further pickings the same shall be recorded compulsorily in the mobile application/ CCE-Agri App while
conducting the current picking experiment. In such cases, no multiplication factor may be used for
calculation of AY.

The Actual Yield Data at GopU level shall be automatically synchronised with the Portal through online
CCE mobile application. Once the Actual Yield data is available on the Portal, the same shall be verified
and approved by the concerned District/State authorities. For those experiments which were
conducted offline/without mobile application, the Actual Yield data, along with the location
information shall be uploaded by the concerned District administration or State nodal department on
the Portal itself. This shall be an exception to be exercised in rare cases and CCEs should not exceed
5% of total CCEs. Actual Yield data through any other mode other than through National Crop

www.pmfby.gov.in 30
Revised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY

Insurance Portal shall not be accepted. If yield data is not uploaded/ synchronised /approved within
pre-defined cut-off date by the concerned authority/department, the concerned Insurance Company,
may inform State Govt. /Central Govt. well in time for taking appropriate action.

18.3.8.6 Insurance Company should be given complete access to co-witness the CCEs, the digital images of the
CCEs and relevant data in the requisite format (electronic/physical) by the State Govt. on real time
basis (Para 35.2.11). A schedule should be formally given/ shared with Insurance Companies
sufficiently in advance without fail to help them to coordinate with field functionaries and mobilize
their manpower accordingly. For this purpose, Insurance Company shall permanently station one
representative at the concerned dist office of the dept/ agency mandated to conduct CCEs for proper
day to day liaison (Para 18.3.6). State shall provide necessary space in the concerned office & facilitate
sharing of information.
19. Dispute resolution regarding Yield Data/Crop loss
19.1 It has been seen, during first two years of implementation of PMFBY, there are various types of yield
disputes, which unnecessarily delays the claim settlement. Following figure shows the procedures to
be adopted in various cases.

condition the Insurance Company in consultation with State Govt. can make use of various products
(e.g. Satellite based Vegetation Index, Weather parameters, etc.) or other technologies (including
statistical test, crop models etc.) to confirm yield estimates. If Insurance Company witnesses any
anomaly/deficiency in the actual yield data(partial /consolidated) received from the State Govt., the

same shall be brought into the notice of concerned State department within 7 days from date of
receipt of yield data with specific observations/remarks under intimation to Govt. of India and
anomaly, if any, may be resolved in next 7 days by the State Level Coordination Committee (SLCC)
headed by Additional Chief Secretary/Principal Secretary/Secretary of the concerned department. This
committee shall be authorized to decide all such cases and the decision in such cases shall be final. The
SLCC may refer the case to State Level Technical Advisory Committee (STAC) for dispute resolution
(Constitution of STAC is defined in Para 19.5). In case the matter stands unresolved even after
examination by STAC, it may be escalated to TAC along with all relevant documents including minutes
of meetings/records of discussion and report of the STAC and SLCC. Reference to TAC can be made
thereafter only in conditions specified in Para 19.7.1 However, data with anomalies which is not
reported within 7 days will be treated as accepted to insurance company. The protocol of timelines
defined above shall also be applicable to the actual Yield data being provided by the concerned State
department in batches, i.e. Crop-wise-District-wise lots of data and timelines for each batch of data
shall be counted separately/batch wise. Unnecessary delay in finalization of yield data will attract
penal interest on due claim amount payable to the farmers as decided by the SLCC in the matter.

The existing Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) comprising of representatives from Directorate of
Economics and Statistics, DAC&FW, MNCFC, NSSO, IASRI, will be further augmented and constituted
under the chairmanship of Additional Secretary, DAC&FW and additional members depending on
case to case basis will be drawn from various organizations namely, relevant institution under Indian
Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR), Indian Agriculture Research Institute (IARI), National Remote
Sensing Centre (NRSC), Space Applications Centre (SAC), Central Statistical Organization(CSO),
Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority of India (IRDA!), Reserve Bank of India (RBI),
National Bank for Agriculture & Rural Development (NABARD), India Meteorological Department (IMD)
or any other such organisation.

The role of TAC shall be to review the technical matters related to execution of the Scheme. In case,
the matter requires further focused deliberations, the TAC will refer the issue to Technical Agency (as
defined in the SOP for yield dispute). Technical Agency (TA) will compulsorily take
input/reports/relevant information from concerned State Department and Insurance Company and
may also opt for representatives of other organizations/experts (if required) with permission of
chairman of TAC and follow the procedure as defined in the SOP.

State shall also constitute the State Level Technical Advisory Committee (STAC) on similar pattern to
resolve disputes. The STAC may be chaired by the Principal Secretary/Secretary of the concerned
department with members from State Agricultural University, State Remote Sensing Centre, IMD (state
centre), DES, any ICAR centre in the state, NSSO, etc.). However, in case of disagreement between the
concerned parties, the case may be referred to TAC along with recommendations and findings for
further deliberation/examination and decision.

TAC/TA/STAC shall deliberate and examine the subject matter and indicate their views /decisions
based on statistical/technological inputs and other related scientific and technical parameters as
detailed in the SOP.

The SOP to deal with yield dispute cases is as under:

When to use this SOP: This SOP will be followed only when there is a dispute about the crop yield

values between the State Government and the Insurance Company and this has not been resolved at

SLCC level and STAC (Para 19.2) and the matter has been referred to the Central Government

Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), which in turn decides that the matter needs to be referred to a

Technical Agency (TA). The dispute can be brought to TAC, only in the case, where all of the following

conditions are satisfied. All conditions not falling in these criteria shall be decided by SLCC and their

decision shall be final and binding on all concerned.

© There is more than 25% difference between the yield estimated by the State government and the
insurance company.

© There is sufficient documentary evidence that the CCEs have not been conducted in required
number and following the standard protocol, in at least 20% area of the 1Us for the particular crop
in the Cluster.

¢ The matter has been considered by the SLCC and. STAC but could not be resolved at State level.

e The Insurance Company has already carried out technical analysis of data in consultation of State
Govt. or in collaboration with Central/State agencies and has used satellite/model/weather data to
support its claim.

The Organizations to which TAC can refer the case to: The organizations can be Central Govt. or
autonomous organizations, which have requisite capacity to carry out such analyses, such as: MNCFC
(DAC&FW), SAC (ISRO), NRSC (ISRO) and other similar government/non-government organizations (e.g.

Data to be provided by Insurance Company:

Data of the co-observed CCEs collected by Insurance Companies in digital format, (preferably
Excel), along with photographs and other collateral data, as collected during CCE

Data of weather observatories", if maintained or sourced by Insurance Companies, in the contested

Detailed reasons for the yield data being perceived as contested.

Any UAV data/output collected from the contested area

(*This data shall only be considered where prior approval for such agency has been taken from State
Govt. as outlined in para 2.13)

Analysis to be carried out by the Technical Agency:

Among the steps given below, any 3 steps should be followed froma to d and any one step should be
followed from e to f. The steps in g and h are compulsory.

Statistical analysis of the CCE yield data: Basic Statistical Parameters (Mean, Variance, CV, Range,
Standard Error, etc.) Scatter plots, Test of Normality (Shapiro-Wilk test, Quartile- Quartile plot,
Whiskers box plot, Skewness and Kurtosis, etc.). It also needs to be checked whether CCEs were
done using the proper sampling design, Village level crop area may also be checked to identify
reasons for lower number of CCE.

Analysis of Weather Data: Weekly Rainfall Deviations (at least at block level) or at grid level using
gridded or satellite based data, Dry-spell. Occurrence, Temperature Anomaly, Soil Moisture Analysis
(either from satellite or model data),and any other available weather parameters (related to crop
condition), either from ground or satellite data. Another rainfall based index, which can also be
studied, is Standardized Precipitation Index (SP!). SPI can be developed using IMD gridded rainfall
data or NOAA CPC rainfall data. However, while using gridded data (either from satellite or ground
stations), appropriate resolution should be used at appropriate level. For example, 0.25 degree
data should be used only at district level and not at block/village level. High resolution weather
data can also be sourced from weather companies.

Analysis of Long-term Yield Data: Previous 10 years’ yield data (at GP or Taluka level) analysis
should be carried out to assess the ups and downs. The analysis would include yield ranges, mean
yield, standard deviation, and CV.

Analysis of Other collateral data: Other data or reports, which should be considered, include Crop
Weather Watch Report, NSSO Supervised CCE data, FASAL programme crop reports, drought
assessment reports prepared by MNCFC, Market arrivals and prices data for 2-3 years
(http://agmarknet.gov.in/), crop condition data available on VEDAS platform
(https://vedas.sac.gov.in/vedas/), Disaster maps available on Bhuvan platform, IMD weather
bulletins, weather information/forecasts available on MOSDAC (https://www.mosdac.gov.in/),
etc.

Analysis of Vegetation Index from Satellite Data: The vegetation index, which can be used for this
purpose are Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Wetness Index

www.pmfby.gov.in 34
Revised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY

(NDWI), Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), Temperature Condition index (TCI), Vegetation Health
Index (VHI), Enhance Vegetation Index (EVI), etc. To derive these indices, satellite data of
appropriate resolution should be used (Table 6).
Table 6 : Types of resolution to be used for vegetation index derivation for different levels of
analysis

Level of | Spatial Examples of Satellite/Sensor
Analysis Resolution
to be used

Village level 5-10 m or | Resourcesat 2/2A: LISS IV (5.8m), Sentinel 2:MSI (10 m); Rapid Eye (6.5
better m); SPOT 5 HRG (5,10 m)

Block/Tehsil 10-30 m Resourcesat 2/2A: LISS'IIl,(23.5 m), Landsat 8: OLI (30 m); Sentinel 2:MSI
level (10 m)

District level | 50-100 m_. | Resourcesat 2/2A: AWiFS (56 m); Proba V (100 m)

However, wherever long-term satellite data is needed MODIS (250 m) data can be used, but it should
not be used for village level for information. Ideally for deriving crop specific vegetation indices, crop
maps should be overlaid on the data. Generally for few major crops, crop maps are prepared under
FASAL project of DAC&FW. Crop maps can be generated using either optical or microwave remote
sensing (SAR) data of appropriate resolution. Wherever, crop maps are not available, at least
agricultural area map should be used. For assessing NDVI or NDWI deviation percentage, data of latest
2-3 years should be used or at least dataiof a normal crop year should be used.

* Crop Growth Modelling: Yield loss estimates can be made using crop simulation models such as
DSSAT/ InfoCrop, etc. Remote sensing based semi-physical modelling approach can also be used
for crop growth analysis. However, care should be taken to use well calibrated and validated
models and also models should be run in spatial at higher resolution, at least 5 km.

¢ — Identification of Outliers: All these above analyses can be used to check whether there was any
reason for yield deviation as presented in the CCE data. Then a yield proxy map may be prepared.
The Yield proxy map canbe derived from remote sensing vegetation indices (single or
combination of indices), crop simulation model output, or an integration of various parameters,
which are related to crop yield, such as soil, weather (gridded), satellite based products, etc.
Whatever, yield proxies to be used, it is the responsibility of the organization to record
documentary evidence (from their or other’s published work) that the yield proxy is related to the
particular crop’s yield. Then the IU level yields need to be overlaid on the yield proxy map. Both
yield proxy and CCE yield can be divided into 4-5 categories (e.g. Very good, Good, Medium, Poor,
Very poor). Wherever there is large mismatch between yield proxy and the CCE yield (more than 2
levels), the CCE yield for that IU can be considered, as outliers.

* Computing Yield for the Outliers: For the |Us, where the yield was considered as outlier, the yield
may be estimated by developing empirical models (statistically significant) between long-term
yield data (at IU level or, if not available, higher administrative level) and weather and remote
sensing based index data. Using these models, yield for the concerned year should be estimated.

Revised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY

19.7.6

19.7.7

19.7.8

The final yield can be estimated as a combination of CCE Yield and model estimated. The
weightage to be given to each estimate will depend upon the quality of each estimate (CCE or
Model). Low weightage should be given to CCE not conducted properly (without photograph, geo
location, proper sampling plan etc.). Similarly lower weightage to be given model estimates, if
model is statistically not highly significant. Wherever, if the model was not statistically significant
the average of estimated yields of adjacent blocks should be used (Note: Each and every case may
have specific and special cause related to a problem and may not be considered as a reference for
any other case.) Each time, the stage of the crop should be given prior importance e.g. 10 mm
rainfall at vegetative stage and at harvest or post-harvest stage has different impacts; a small
amount rainfall having devastating wind-speed have different impact than high amount of rainfall
having calm or no-wind. The Technical Agency needs to take into account all these factors to
consider each of the cases as an individual and special case.

Time required for the analysis: The analysis needs to be completed by the concerned technical
agency, within one month of receipt of all mentioned data from the Insurance Company and the State
Government.

Funds needed for the analysis: All the analysis will be carried out by the Technical Agency, with its
existing resources. However, if there is any need of procurement of priced data or services, this may
be funded by the concerned Insurance Agency or the State Government, whichever organization has
brought the dispute issue up to TAC.

General Suggestions: Though this SOP identifies the procedure for yield dispute resolutions, in a long
run, it will benefit the scheme and the farmers, if there is no Dispute. Following suggestions are made
to avoid dispute.

The States should conduct the CCEs following the standard procedure (proper sampling plan) and
collect the data using Smartphone based Android App

States need to pro-actively use technology for more accurate crop yield estimation

States should develop mechanism to resolve disputes at State level by technical support from State
level organizations, such as Agricultural Universities, State Remote Sensing Centres, ICAR Centres
located in the State, local IMD office, etc.

The Insurance Companies should proactively, get involved with the States for supervision of CCEs.
The Insurance Companies should more and more invest in use of technology to support the loss
assessment.

There should be better coordination between the State and the Insurance Companies.

Use of Innovative Technologies

To Rationalize CCEs: With availability of a number of satellites with high resolution imaging
capability orbiting the Earth, there is a great improvement in satellite remote sensing based products.
It has been reasonably proven that satellite based vegetation indices (such as, Normalized Difference
Vegetation Index, NDVI and Normalized Difference Wetness Index, NDWI) can help in demarcating the
cropped areas into clusters on the basis of crop health. This feature can be successfully used to target
the CCEs within the Insurance Unit (IU). In other words, satellite imagery can help in ‘smart sampling’
(stratified sampling) of CCEs. This will help in optimizing the number of CCEs, to make them
representative of different crop conditions. This is expected to reduce the total need of CCEs by about
30-40% while maintaining similar accuracy. It will also give a more representative yield of the IU, as it
will consider all crop pixels (fields) within the IU and not just location of 4 CCEs. States can adopt this
technique (of using satellite based remote sensing data for planning of Crop Cutting Experiments) in
generating yield estimates while following digital protocol outlined in the preceding paragraphs. For
using satellite data for smart sampling, there is a need to generate specific crop map. MNCFC under
the FASAL project of the DAC&FW prepares crop maps for various crops, as mentioned in Section 25,
para 25.4. These crop maps can be used forCCE planning. Vegetation Indices (NDVI and NWDI) need to
be computed for the cropped area. On the basis of Vegetation Index, the crop area can be categorized
into poor, medium, good and very good crop health strata. Within each stratum, CCE points should be
selected randomly. Additionally, ground truthing within these !Us can be done in order to develop crop
yield model to ascertain yield estimation of the crop and simultaneously can act as a
reconciliation/verification tool of actual CCEs conducted on the field. This can be done in consultation
with MNCFC, NRSC (ISRO), SAC (ISRO), SRSC and IASRI. This Department has also been piloting such
studies, in this regard, for optimization/reduction of crop cutting experiments using technology.

To remove Area Discrepancy in coverage: It is noticed that in some instances in States/districts,
area insured is much more than area sown figures hence, compulsory use of RST/ satellite imagery,
digitization of land records needs to be done to minimize the area discrepancy. For this detailed
procedure has been laid down in section 25

For Direct Yield Estimation

For addressing the issue of reliability of CCEs in terms of their accuracy, representativeness and
timeliness, innovative technologies such as satellite remote sensing, drone, modeling, AWS/ARG, real
time transmission of data etc. should be utilized. This will ensure accurate assessment of yield and
timely payment of claims to farmers. Various studies carried out by national and international
organizations, including MNCFC, NRSC, SAC, CCAFS, IRRI, IFPRI, World Bank, etc. have shown that the
use of satellite, weather, soil and crop data, along with images/video capture of crop growth at various
stages and accurate sample CCE data collection can improve the yield data quality/ timeliness and
support timely claim processing and payments.

States, with the support of national centres as mentioned above, SRSC and SAUs, need to carry out
adequate number of pilot studies for improved yield estimation using technology, as mentioned

www.pmfby.gov.in 37
Revised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY

20.4

above, and small number of good quality CCEs. When a significant correlation is observed between
remote sensing and weather estimated yield and yield estimated through CCEs, States and Insurance
Companies can use these technologies in estimating the crop yields at IU level, subject to the
satisfaction of both States and Insurance Companies about the accuracy of the yield estimates, to
service the claims.

To improve Yield-data Quality and Timeliness

It has been observed that the normall CCE process being followed by the State for estimating yield is
lacking in reliability, accuracy and speed, which affects claim settlement. There is a need for real
time, good quality and reliable actual yield-data for which mandatory use of smart phones / hand held
devices has to be done for capturing images, location of the CCE and for online transmission of data on
National Crop Insurance Portal through»CCEs Agri-app: RST using satellite and drones, weather data,
model etc. may also be used for the purpose of increasing accuracy and speed of yield estimation
through CCEs.

The cost of using technology etc. for conduct of CCE process specially purchase of smart phones/ hand
held devices and use of technology (RST, Drone etc.).will be shared between Central Govt. and State
Govts/ U.Ts on 50:50 basis, wherever necessary, subject to a cap on total funds to be made available by
Central Govt. for this purpose based on approximate Cost of procuring handheld devices/smart phones
and other related costs (RST, Drone, etc).

Technology Fund: A technology fund will be created by GO! wherein resources shall be allocated for
meeting 5% of GOI share/100% grant in various technological interventions undertaken by State Govt.
funds as admissible. The fund shall be augmented with excess farmers share of premium surrendered
by Insurance Company due to application of ACF and penalties imposed on Insurance Companies on
account of poor performance by Insurance Companies as per the parameters outlined in Annexure 2

Assessment of Claims

21.1

21.1.1

Wide Spread Calamities

If ‘Actual Yield’ (AY) per hectare of insured crop for the insurance unit (calculated on basis of requisite
number of CCEs) in insured season, falls short of specified ‘Threshold Yield’ (TY), all insured farmers
growing that crop in the defined area are deemed to have suffered shortfall of similar magnitude in
yield. PMFBY seeks to provide coverage against such contingency.
‘Claim’ shall be calculated at IU level as per the following formula:

(Threshold Yield — Actual Yield)

-------------—- X Sum Insured

Threshold Yield

Where Threshold Yield (TY) for a crop in a notified insurance unit is the average yield of best 5 years
from past seven years of that season multiplied by applicable Indemnity Level for that crop

The years of 2012-13 and 2014-15 have the lowest yields.

Total of yields of seven years is 22350 kg/ha and that of two lowest yield years is 3550kg/ha
i.e.(1800+1750). Therefore according to the provision, average of best five years excluding two lowest
yield years will be (22350-3550=18800/5) i.e. 3760 kg/ha. Hence, threshold yield at 90%, 80% and 70%
of indemnity levels will be 3384kg/ha, 3008kg/ha and 2632 kg/ha respectively.

On Account Payment of Claims due to Mid-Season Adversity

Insurance cover will be provided to the farmers to provide immediate relief in case of adverse
seasonal conditions during the crop season viz. floods, prolonged dry spells, severe drought etc.,
wherein expected yield during the season is likely to be less than 50% of Normal Yield.

Eligibility Criteria:

All notified |Us would be eligible for “ON ACCOUNT” payment only if the expected Yield of the affected
crop during the season is less than 50% of Normal Yield.

The provision could be invoked for a specific crop or group of crops in notified IU, by the State Govt.
through damage notification based on the proxy indicators and depending on fulfilment of laid down
conditions

The quantum of likely losses and the amount of ‘on-account’ payment shall be decided based on the
joint survey by Insurance Company and State Govt. officials.

Only those farmers would be eligible for financial support under this cover who have paid the
premium / the premium has been debited from their account before the damage notification by the
State Govt. for invoking this provision for compensation. Banks must ensure to debit farmers premium
within 15 days from sanction/renewal of KCC/crop loan to provide benefit of this add on products ,
failing which banks will be liable to meet the claim liabilities of uncovered eligible famers.

Amount payable would be 25% of the likely claims, subject to adjustment against final claims.

If adversity occurs within 15 days before the normal harvest time, this provision will not be invoked.
Then the losses will not qualify under this provision.

Proxy-Indicators: Indicators to be used for loss intimation could be rainfall data, other weather data,
satellite imagery, drought assessment reports of MNCFC and crop condition reports by district level/
State Govt. officials, supported by media report and field photographs. The State’s notification should
also spell out all the necessary details in this regard.

Loss assessment procedure:

Joint Committee of State Govt. and the Insurer for assessment of crop damage have to be formed and
notified before start of the crop season by the SLCCCI for each district.

This Joint Committee shall decide the eligibility for On-Account payment based on the weather data
(available AWS notified by the Govt.)/long term average rainfall data/satellite imagery supported by
estimated yield losses at notified IU level. Loss intimation order has to be issued within 7days from the
adverse seasonal event.

Based on the above report, a joint inspection of the affected area maybe done by Insurance Company
along with State Govt officials for ground truthing using mobile phone App and arrive at the extent of
loss.

Information/ Services of MNCFC, ISRO or SRSC may also be utilized for determination of extent of loss,
using satellite data, for On Account payout.

If the expected loss of the affected crop is more than 50% of the normal yield for the Notified
Insurance Unit, On-Account payment would be payable.

On-Account payment would be calculated as per following formula:
(Threshold Yield-Estimated Yield)

ao x Sum Insured x25%
Threshold Yield

Timeframe for loss assessment and submission of report:

An order will be issued by Nodal Dept. of State Govt. defining eligibility of On Account payment with
details of affected IUs within 7 days from the occurrence of adverse seasonal event.

Loss assessment report at the affected insurance unit level has to be completed by the Joint
Committee within 15 days from occurrence of the adverse seasonal event.

Conditions:

Mere disbursement/ sanction of loan without receipt/ debit of premium before the notification of
calamity would not make a farmer eligible for the claim.

The On-Account payment would be disbursed by the Insurance Company without waiting for the
receipt of final share of Govt. subsidy (Second Instalment)

On Account payment would be paid to all eligible insured farmers within one month of the notification
invoking this provision by the State Govt. and subject to receipt of loss assessment report from State
Govt..

These claims would be adjusted against the end season area approach yield based claims.

Bank would remit farmers’ premium to Insurance Company, with farmers list, within 7 days of

intimation of loss under this section, if not uploaded earlier on Portal. However, this option must be
exercised as a last recourse with proper justification.

Illustration

District ‘A’ has been affected by floods having 100 insurance units under Crop ‘xX’. Out of which 50
insurance units were severely affected and as per the weather indicators / agro-met data, it has been
assessed that 30 IUs could have yield loss of more than 50% of the normal yield. Out of these 30
insurance units, estimated yield loss for 5 units is 80% (Category-l), for another 10 units, it is 70%
(Category-Il) and remaining 15units, it is 60% (Category-Ill) of normal average yield. As per declarations
received, if sum insured for notified areas in Category-|, Category-ll and Category-lll is Rs. 1 crore, Rs. 2
crore, and Rs 3 crore, respectively, then likely total claims will be Rs. 80 lakh, 140 lakh and 180 lakh,
respectively. Hence on-account claims upto 25% shall be Rs.20 lakh, 35 lakh and 45 lakh, which will be
released during the season subject to receipt of premium subsidy.

Insurance Companies may also provide input to the State in this regard with substantial evidence for
consideration within the stipulated time so that claim of Insurance Companies may be verified by
them. If Insurance Company makes such a case then State Govt. is bound to get it examined within a
stipulated time of 7 days and in case State Govt. thinks that Prevented Sowing is not made out then
they should inform Insurance Companies giving cogent reasons for the same.

Only those farmers would be eligible for financial support under this cover who have paid the
premium / the premium has been debited from their account before the damage notification by the
State Govt. for invoking this provision for compensation. Banks must ensure to debit farmers premium
within 15 days from sanction/renewal of KCC/crop loan to provide benefit of this add on products ,
failing which banks will be liable to meet the claim liabilities of uncovered eligible farmers.

The State Govt. would notify crop wise and agro-climatic zone or district wise cut-off dates by which,
this provision could be invoked but this notification should not be later than 15 days from cut off date
for enrolment of farmer.

Insurance companies may appeal to invoke prevented sowing within prescribed period with proper
evidence. In case, this provision is not invoked by:the DL JC, Insurance Company may escalate the
same in writing to State Govt.

Proxy-Indicators: Indicators to be used for loss intimations could be rainfall data, other weather data,
satellite imagery and crop condition reports by district level / State Govt. official, media reports and

of claim disbursal on notice board to enable spread of awareness and inclination amongst farming
community for risk mitigation through crop insurance. Insurance Company is required to compulsorily
upload the claim details against each insured farmer on National crop insurance Portal.

In case of farmers covered on voluntary basis through intermediaries, payable claims will directly be
credited to the bank accounts of concerned insured farmers and details of the claims may also be
intimated to them. The list of beneficiaries shall also be uploaded on National Crop Insurance Portal
immediately.

In case of claims under prevented/failed sowing, localized calamities, post- harvest losses; Insurance
Company will process the claims after assessment and shall release the claims as per detailed
procedure given in the relevant sections above.

The claim settlement intimation shall be sent to each beneficiary farmer through SMS from the Portal
itself. State Govts, Banks & Insurance companies shall ensure correctness of data before hand viz.
Threshold Yield, Actual Yield, Insured Area, Sum Insured and Indemnity levels etc. Responsibility of any
error, omissions and mis-reporting shall lie with the concerned State Nodal Department and insurance
Company. State Govt. & Insurance Companies shall resolve all the grievances of the insured farmers
and other stakeholders in the shortest possible time.

In any situation, State Govt. can not reopen/ re calculate claims after 30 days of claims settlement for
notified crop(s) at notified unit. Disputed claims / sub-standard claims , if any, due to erroneous data
may be referred within this time to SLCC/STAC and further to Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), if
required, for consideration and decision

Insurance companies should have received the premium for coverage either from bank, channel
partner, insurance intermediary or directly. In case of any loss in transit due to negligence by these
agencies or non remittance of premium by these agencies, the concerned bank/intermediaries shall be
liable for payment of claims.

In_case of any substantial _misre: bank /branch in case of compulsory farmers
coverage, the concerned bank only shall be liable for such mis-reporting.

Mere sanctioning/ disbursement of crop loans and submission of proposals/ declarations and
remittance of premium by farmer/bank, without explicit intent to raise the crop, does not constitute
acceptance of risk by Insurance Company.

Acreage discrepancy

Some areas in the past have reported excess insurance coverage vis-a-vis planted acreage, leading to over-
insurance. Ideally the discrepancy should be handled at farm level to protect the interest of farmers
with genuine insurance coverage. All suitable measures are being taken by concerned stakeholders for
de duplication with the help of Aadhaar Number, land records, banks records, revenue records and
proposal/loan application of insured farmers. The details of individual insured farmers are being
collected on National Crop Insurance Portal for de duplication. However, in the absence of digitized
farm records on a GIS platform and its integration with the Portal, it would be cumbersome to
physically verify each farm when the reported discrepancies are comparatively large compared to the
sown areas. Moreover, the scheme also covers the risk of prevented sowing/germination failure which
is not being included in sowing areas furnished by the,State Government for arriving of sown area of
crop the during the season. State wise List of such major crops will be notified by DAC&FW in
consultation with MNCFC from time to time before beginning of every season.

Under the scheme, notified crops are being insured by the Insurance companies on the basis of
actuarial premium rate, hence, it is not.their prerogative to reduce the Sum Insured and resultant
claims on the application of ACF. However, to rationalize the government subsidy, it the
responsibilities of all concerned stakeholders including farmers and financial institutions to insured the
crop which farmer actually intend to sow/actually sown. Option to change the insured crop has also
been provided under the scheme for reporting of crop(s) actually sown for the insurance. There is
also a provision to indemnify the crop)losses due to localized perils on the basis of survey of
individual plot/field under insured crops. Any wrong reporting of insured crops may lead to
forfeiting of claims, if the crop actually sown and insured will be different.

Area Discrepancy will be applied only to those major crops for which Normal area sown data at the
Block/Taluka level shall be provided by MNCFC based on the remote sensing data etc after factoring
the areas remains unsown and failed germination/plantation due to adverse climatic conditions and
shall be made available on National Crop Insurance Portal. No other data from any source including
State Govt. will be considered.

However, any mass irregularities/anomalies in insuring of excess area i.e. more than the published
cultivable area at Taluka level should compulsorily be brought to the notice of DAC&FW, in writing
after cut off date of enrolment but before the period specified for reconciliation with banks along with
facts/documents and list of bank branches etc so that the same may be examined by the Government
and rectified by concerned bank itself before finalisation of business Statistics for the season on Portal

Decision of GOI in applicability of discrepancy in insured area shall be binding on all.

If the difference between insured area and sown area provided by MNCFC is >30% at Block/Tehsil/
Taluka , all |Us of such Block/Tehsil/ Taluka will fall under acreage discrepancy category and should be
treated as having ‘excess’ insurance coverage.

Data on application of ACF shall be uploaded on National Crop Insurance Portal.

Adequate publicity needs to be given in all the villages of the notified districts/areas. All possible
means of electronic and print media, farmer's fair, exhibitions, SMS, short films, and documentaries
shall be utilized to create and disseminate awareness about provisions and benefits of the Scheme
among the cultivators and the agencies involved in implementing the Scheme. Agriculture/
Cooperation Departments of the State shall work out appropriate plan for awareness generation and
publicity on an on-going basis from three months prior to the start of coverage period. Similarly,
Insurance Companies will conduct Publicity and Awareness immediately on receipt of award of work.
All the publicity material/ information should necessarily be uploaded on the National Crop Insurance
Portal along with coverage/frequency/ duration date etc.

The State Govt./ UT in collaboration with Insurance Companies shall also chalk out plan for capacity
building of the associated agents, banks ete for effective implementation of the Scheme and organize
training workshops/ sensitization programme for them in association with participating Insurance
Companies.

Insurance company should spend 0.5% of the total gross premium for publicity expenses at the field
level and the corresponding details should be submitted to GOI and State govt. at the end of every
season. In case of expenditure in this category is less than 0.5% of Total Gross Premium, the IC shall
deposit the difference in Technology fund within 3 months of cut off date for enrolment.

Service Charges

To Banks

Bank and other financial institutions etc. shall be paid service charges @ 4% of the farmer’s share of
premium by Insurance Company as generated from the Portal and within the 15 days of finalization of
business statistics. Rural agents engaged in providing insurance related services to farmers may be
paid appropriate commission as decided by Insurance Company, subject to cap prescribed under IRDAI
regulations. If there is delay in payment of service charges by Insurance Company beyond 15 days of
finalization of business statistics, amount needs to be paid with interest @12% p.a.

Even if the farmer’s share of premium is contributed/financed by the concerned State Govt. the
applicable service charges shall be paid by the concerned Insurance Company only.

No service charges will be payable to the concerned bank/branch for the applications for which any

Monitoring and Review of the Scheme

29.2.1

29.2.2

29.2.3

State Level Coordination Committee om Crop Insurance (SLCCCI) of the concerned State will be
responsible for monitoring of the Schemes/programme in its State. However, a National Level
Monitoring Committee (NLMC) under the chairmanship of Secretary, DAC & FW will monitor the
Scheme at the national level.

It is proposed to take following monitoring measures for effective implementation during each crop
season to ensure maximum benefits to the farmers:

The Bank branches/CSCs/ intermediaries may collect the details of individual insured farmers (both
loanee and non-loanee) like name, fathers’ name, Bank Account number, Aadhaar number village,
categories — small and marginal/SC/ST/women, insured acreage, insured crop(s), sum insured,
premium collected, Govt. subsidy eteand submit electronically using web form or CBS Integration
module along with electronic submission of crop wise consolidated declarations on or before final cut-
off date.. Yield data based on CCEs shall be made available online on National Crop Insurance Portal to
the concerned Insurance Company by the State Govt. within a month from the date of final harvest of
individual crop.

Calculation of ACF if any shall be made immediately after receipt of insured acreage and sown area
data but not later than the onset of CCEs similarly any anomaly in the actual yield data shall
immediately be brought into the notice of concerned State Govt. and not later than 15 days from final
receipt of actual yield data as detailed in section 25.

Insurance Companies shall calculate crop-wise, |U wise payable claims based on the actual yield data
and threshold yield given at the time of tendering. Accordingly the payable claims subject to payment

Companies directly into benefitted farmer’s accounts electronically, payment details for which shall be
updated on the National Crop Insurance Portal on daily basis.

After receiving the claims amount from the concerned Insurance Companies, the financial
institutions/banks should display the list of the beneficiaries/details of claims (both loanee and non-
loanee) on the notice board of the branch within seven days with details of beneficiaries like Name of
farmers/beneficiaries, crops insured, sum insured, amount of claims received etc.

The list of beneficiaries (Bank-wise and insured area-wise) shall also be uploaded/ placed on the
website of the concerned Insurance Companies with proper provisions and mechanisms of public
grievance redressal/feed-back etc. State Govts./UT should ensure that crop insurance products
provide comprehensive insurance coverage to the farmers on sound insurance principles and provide
the best value for the premium. State Govt. may also review the progress of Scheme periodically and
undertake impact assessment after the completion of each season and send their suggestion/
recommendations to this Department for making further improvements in the Scheme.

About 5% of the beneficiaries may be verified by Regional Offices/Local level Offices of ICs who will
send the feedback to concerned DLMC and)State Govt./SLCCCI on Crop Insurance.

At least 10% of the beneficiaries verified by the IC may be cross verified by the concerned DLMC and
they should send the feed back to State Govt.

1 to 2% of the beneficiaries may be verified by the Head Office of the IC/Independent Agencies
appointed by the Central Govt./NLMC and they Should send the necessary feed back to Central
Government.

31.2

Empanelment Criteria

The Public Sector (AIC& others) and Private Sector General Insurance Companies empanelled by DAC
& FW and selected by concerned State Govt. / Union Territory (UT) shall implement the PMFBY. The
Insurance Companies mainly engaged in»agriculture/rural insurance business and having adequate
experience, infrastructure, financial strength and operational capabilities are empanelled by DAC&FW.
Once Insurance Company has been empanelled by DAC &FW, it is considered as pre-qualified
company to bid for the selection of Implementing Agency (IA) to undertake implementation of the
Scheme/Programme of DAC&FW.

L1 bidder shall not be permitted to surrender partial clusters/districts. If any Insurance Company declines
after being declared L1, it will be de-empanelled/ de-barred to implement crop insurance Scheme for
the coming/next season(s) in the concerned State and L2 may be given the cluster for implementing
the crop insurance Scheme at L1 district-crop combination rates and so on to L3, L4 bidder with their
consent. All Such bidders will be required to simultaneously furnish appropriate reasons for
withdrawal/surrender/non acceptance in writing to State Govt. with copy to DAC&FW to enable further
corrective measures and appropriate administrative & legal action accordingly. Financial losses, if any, to
the State Govt., in retendering due to withdrawal of selected bidders, will be recovered from withdrawing
L1 bidder.

Tender should be preferably for 3 years and in no case less than 1 year

Each Insurance Company should compulsorily bid for any 3 NER/Hilly States and 2 UTs

32.

The selection of Insurance Company from the empanelled Insurance Companies to act as
Implementing Agency (IA) shall be done by the concerned State/UT Govt. for implementation of the
Scheme in their State. Selection of IA will be made by adopting the cluster approach. In case of smaller
States, the whole State may be assigned to one IA.

Before the commencement of the crop season, State Govt. would invite the pre-qualified companies
as mentioned in the preceding para through open tender for submission of district-wise and crop-
wise actuarial premium rates in percentage of Sum Insured (financial bid). Indemnity Level,
Threshold Yields, Sum Insured etc. will be same for all Insurance Companies for the season. The
empanelled companies participating in bidding have to bid the premium rates for all the crops notified
/ to be notified in the cluster by the State Govt. and non-compliance will lead to rejection of the bid.

Based on the district-wise and crop-wise actuarial premium rates quoted by the pre-qualified
companies, the total premium amount and weighted average premium rates for cluster of districts will
be worked out to arrive at L1. L1 Bidder will be selected to act as Implementing Agency in the
concerned cluster.

Selection of [A may be made for at least 1 year or up to three years as mentioned above Such long
term continuity will facilitate the Insurance Company to establish the credibility among the farmers
through investment out of the premium savings in, various welfare activities for socio-economic
development of the farmers like creation of the facilities of drinking water/ healthcare/education,
farm levelling, Weather Forecasts, CSCs etc. It.is also anticipated that long term continuity gives an
opportunity to Insurers, Bankers, State Govt. and other stakeholders for a supportive and collaborative
interaction and business relationship and service effectiveness.

The insurance coverage in terms of number of farmers and acreage should be at least at the level of
corresponding previous season. In case of fall in coverage, GO! may get the facts examined and
necessary action including penal action against negative points in ranking for ICs and State Govt., if
found at fault may be taken by GOI.

State Govt. may provide requisite data about past yield data of last 10 consecutive years or more,
threshold yield, crop-wise sum insured, indemnity level, insurance unit levels, names of notified units,
calamity years etc. in digital form by uploading the same on National Crop Insurance Portal itself
before floating the formal tender notice.

Clustering /clubbing of districts for bidding by the State

In order to diversify/ spread the risk and cover high risk/ low risk districts/ area equally, the State
Government are required to group the districts/ area in such a way that each group contains mix of
districts/ area with different risk profiles. Prior to inviting the bid, the State Government specially large
State have to divide the State in to multiple clusters of districts depending upon volume of risk
associated in the crops and district/areas proposed to be notified under the Scheme. The purpose of
clustering is to divide the States into different groups of districts, so that expected sum insured (ESI)
becomes low and risk is shared and diversified. States may form the clusters of districts based on

www.pmfby.gov.in 62
Revised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY

mixed agro-climatic zones. i) Districts of high risk and low risk areas, ii) districts of different agro-
climatic zones, and iii) ES! is of each cluster should be of similar order.

Prior to the bid invitation, details on the clusters formation may also be made available to the
Insurance Companies.

The object of Clustering/ Clubbing of districts should be done to achieve the following objectives:

e — Cluster formation may be applicable for upto 3 years.

¢ Different Clusters may be defined based on risk profile of the district so as to increase the
diversification of risk within a cluster and enable risk spreading for insurer.

e Cluster may contain districts with mixed agro-climatic zones so as to increase the diversification of
risk within a cluster.

* Crop wise associated risk may also be diversified among the clusters and shall be factored in
cluster formation.

Hence, one of the major requirements of clustering is risk analysis of different districts. As per 2016
Guidelines of PMFBY, for the purpose of clustering/clubbing of districts and determination of L1
bidder, the risk is analyzed based on long term data of yield by (a) computing average burn cost
(percent difference between actual yield.and threshold yield) and b) computing the level of variability
in long term yield. Since, availability of high quality long term yield data is difficult, especially at lower
administrative level, other methods (including use of satellite data) can be tried for risk assessment.

Satellite data, of moderate resolution (e.g. Resourcesat AWiFS, Terra/Aqua MODIS) are available, for
long term, i.e. at least around 15 years. The long term Vegetation Indices, which are indicators of crop
health, derived from these satellites can be uSed to assess the year to year variations and thereby
understanding the risk potential of an area. It can be combined with many other satellite derived
products, such as flood maps, drought assessments and vulnerability and long term weather data to
carry out the risk analysis. States are advised to take the support of concerned national or State level
research organizations (e.g. ISRO- NRSC/SAC, MNCFC, SRSC, SAUs, etc.), to use the above mentioned
technology for carrying out risk analysis of the Districts/ Talukas/ Blocks towards improvement in
clustering.

These are only for guidance of States and States are free to follow either of these or any other method
devised by them with intimation to DAC&FW.

The detail illustration for classification of risks, clubbing/clustering of risks and districts and
determination of L1 bidder are at Annexure 1.

loan/KCC under Interest Subvention Scheme hence the coverage of loanee farmers without Aadhaar
doesn’t arise and such accounts needs to be reviewed by the concerned bank branch regularly

Insurance Proposals are accepted only upto a stipulated cut-off date, which will be decided by the
SLCCCI. Hence, loanee farmers may ensure themselves from the concerned bank branches that
applicable premium should be debited and remitted to Insurance Companies within cut off date and

National Crop Insurance Portal for administration of Crop
Insurance Program (www.pmfby.gov.in)

The Govt. is endeavouring to integrate all stakeholders’ viz. farmers, Insurance Companies,
financial institutions and Govt. agencies on single IT platform to ensure better administration,
coordination and transparency for getting real time information and monitoring in a phased manner.

The idea behind developing a web-based, integrated IT solution is to speed up service delivery, unify
fragmented databases, achieve a single view of data, eliminate manual processes and thus provide
faster insurance services to farmers. DAC&FW has designed a web Portal for crop insurance
(www.pmfby.gov.in) and is doing further enhancements to provide a single IT enabled platform for
digitization of processes and information data bank jand dissemination mechanism, automation of
administrative procedures, premium and claim calculation and remittance etc. This IT driven system is
envisaged to address the issues which affect the current system of programme administration and thereby
reduce its efficacy and lead to denial/ delay in benefit transfer to farmers viz. selective/layered information
access, manual interventions, multi-step procedures, documentary evidence/proofs, delayed/defective
information sharing. Hence, integration of IT platforms of banks, Insurance Companies, State Govts. and
yield/weather data providers with National Crop Insurance Portal directly or through interface for fetching
in information is felt essential to avoid errors for timely transmission of requisite information amongst
major stakeholders, early settlement of claims, proper'monitoring and transparent administration of the
Schemes. Once the entire linking of IT platforms of all stakeholders with the Web Portal is established, it
would also lead to faster processing of claims due to electronic flow of information. Currently, this Portal is
available in two languages — Hindi and English and it willbe converted into all regional languages.

The aforesaid Portal will provide an integrated ecosystem to streamline the process and to automate
administrative functions. A web-based, integrated IT solution has been developed which has opened a
window of opportunity to remote and economically-weak farmers to benefit from crop insurance
services.

The conceptualisation and development of web-portal has already been completed and launched
however development and integration of futuristic technologies and enhancements as defined below
are envisaged to be initiated in coming months.

Payment of Premium and Remittance of Claims through Payment Gateway: All premium remittance
from Farmers/Banks/Intermediaries and claim remittance from Insurance Companies will be routed
through the Portal using payment gateway Pay-Gov. The facility is envisaged to address reconciliation
of funds and bring swiftness and transparency in claim settlement.

Integration of National Crop Insurance Portal with IT infrastructure of Insurance Company: For
seamless and real-time data flow of following stages to the Insurance Companies, direct integration of
National Crop Insurance Portal with the IT system of respective Insurance Companies will be
established. The information/data will be shared in encrypted form over secure data exchange
platform.

° Farmer's enrolment and premium remittance,
. Information and reports regarding mid-term/preventive sowing/individual/localized claims and
. AY/TY data for final claim calculation and remittance of claims into farmer's bank account.

Integration of Digital Land Records: Various State Govts. are working on digitization of land records
and providing facility to land owners to identify and take records of land parcels owned by them. The
same digitized land records will be mapped with the codes used in National Crop Insurance Portal
followed by online integration of the individual land records with the crop insurance application. This
facility will address the issue of excess insurance/double insurance and application of ACF which is
prevalent currently.

Integration of Weather Data with the Portal: Weather Data procured from a network of Automatic
Weather Stations and Automatic Rain Gauges across the country will be procured from IMD and
integrated with the National Crop Insurance Portal. This will enable real-time monitoring of weather
parameters, agro-climatic inputs, crop health monitoring, triggers for preventive sowing/mid-term
adversities etc. This integration will also facilitate faster, transparent transmission of yield/weather
data to concerned Insurance Companies and automated claim calculation and remittance to
beneficiaries. This feature will ensure availability of real-time information about crop loss and payable
claims vis-a-vis necessary triggers/inputs to Govt. agencies/Implementing agencies so that policy
decisions/administrative corrective measures can be taken.

Integration of Public Grievance Redressal Module: For bringing efficiency in addressing the grievances
of farmers and other stakeholders, a system for registration of complaints and grievances, escalations
and resolution will be integrated with the Portal.

Launch of National Help Line and Integration with Web-Portal: A quick response system is very
crucial for creating trust and bringing behavioural changes and efficiency amongst the stakeholders.
Keeping the same in view, an integrated help line of Kisan Call Center will be launched for benefit of all
the stakeholders for query resolution, technical handholding and specific information dissemination.

Development of Mobile-App for Localized/individual, Preventive/Mid-Term Loss Assessment and
reporting: For bringing in swiftness and accuracy in the information sharing and reporting of
Localized/Individual, Preventive/Mid-Term Losses, a mobile application will be launched for use of loss
assessors/DLMC members. This data collected through app will be immediately sent to National Crop
Insurance Portal which will be accessed by all the stakeholders. This will help in monitoring and fster
analysis and claim settlement.

Integration of Interest Subvention Scheme with Crop Insurance: A web-portal for Interest Subvention
Scheme is also being developed for monitoring and implementation of ISS. This Portal will be inter-
linked with the National Crop Insurance Portal for automatic enrolment of eligible farmers and
deduction of applicable premium. This will also enable de-duplication of KCC/seasonal Crop Loans and
provisioning of services

Integration of RST/Satellite Data for handling Data Discrepancy/dispute resolution: New Age
Technologies like Remote Sensing Technology is a promising step in bringing in procedures and

www.pmfby.gov.in 76
Revised Operational Guidelines of PMFBY

36.4.10

36.4.12

systems of approach which is more reliable, accurate and fast in resolving errors/concerns of
stakeholders and provide a progressive and scientific solution which the traditional/existing
procedures and practices are unable to provide. This will help in reduction in time required for
collection and collation of different data sets and reports pertaining to crop health, productivity,
sowing and harvesting activities.

MNCFC data Integration on Portal: To streamline the flow of information amongst stakeholders, the
portal will also be integrated with the system/data being developed by MNCFC on aforesaid aspects.

Evaluation & Management Information System (E &MIS) for all stakeholders with secured
credential: For monitoring progress of the Scheme, a stakeholder specific customized MIS is also being
developed, which will help in monitoring, application creation, notification status, CCE status etc. to
give a summarised overview of different stages of the Scheme.

Data repository for risk classification and risk mitigation: For the purpose of risk estimation, a
repository is being created which will contain IU wise average yield of insured crops for past decade
and weather data at the level of automatic weather station to analyse crop wise risk calculation before
season starts. This repository will be updated regularly for yield data and weather data.

Applicable conditions for Clustering/ Clubbing of districts:

i. Within the cluster Insurance Companies would be required to quote premium rates for all
district-crop combination for their bids to be evaluated.

ii. | Company not quoting even for one of the total district-crop combinations within the cluster
would be disqualified for the bidding period.

iii. | There would be no further negotiations with the L1 bidder to accept L1 rates of other bidder
for any district crop combination i.e. the rates quoted by the L1 bidder for different district-
crop combination would be applicable within the cluster. Bidding and negotiation conditions

L1 in Cluster1 is company (Z). Similar process would be followed other clusters.
Method 2

Agriculture output in the area/ district is influenced by the agro-climatic conditions of that
area/district. On the basis of the variation in agriculture output(crops) in each district during the last
10 years, districts may be divided in to three categories of low, moderate and high risks to agriculture.
If variation in agriculture output in the district during the last 10 years worked out to be plus
minus<15% then district may be categorized as low risk. Similarly, districts of variation ranging plus
minus 16-30% may be categorized of moderate risks and variation of plus minus >30% as high risks
districts to agriculture operations. Accordingly all districts of the State would be identified as
low/moderate/high risk. Number of clusters to be formed shall be decided according to total no. of
districts in the State. Total no. of each category of low, moderate and high risks districts shall be
divided by no. of clusters to be formed in the State, Then, equal no. of low risk districts shall be
selected randomly for each cluster of districts. Similarly, moderate and high risks districts would be
selected.

Example:

State— UP, No. of districts - 75

Basedonthelast10yearsvariationinoutput, category-wise No. of districts identified:
Low risks 40, Moderate risks 20, High risks 15,

No. of clusters (of preferably 15-20 districts each) to be formed: 75/19 =3.95 say4

Then, no. of low risks districts in each cluster: 40/4 = 10

Similarly, moderate risks districts: 20/4=5 and high risks districts: 15/4=3.75 say 4 As such,
