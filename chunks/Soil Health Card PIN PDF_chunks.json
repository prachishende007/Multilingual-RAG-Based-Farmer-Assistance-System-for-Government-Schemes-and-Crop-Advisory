With 25 acres of land and a family of eleven to support, agriculture is not just his occupation — it is his way of life. For years, he followed the same rice-wheat cropping cycle, relying heavily on chemical fertilisers to chase higher yields. But beneath the surface, his soil was weakening, and so was his peace of mind.\nRising input costs, declining productivity and concerns about soil health began to weigh on him.\n\"I was always concerned about the rising cost of farming, the increasing use of inputs, and the gradual harm being done to my soil.\" Mr Mahendra recal"

After listening to his concerns about crop residue burning and rising costs, Mr Patel suggested something simple but powerful — to get his soil tested under the Soil Health Card Scheme.\n\nKey Takeaways • As of July 2025, over 25 crore Soil Health Cards have been distributed to farmers.\n• As of February 2025: - ➢ ₹1706.18 crore released to States and UTs for the scheme.\n➢ 8,272 soil testing labs set up across the country.

A demonstration was set up on one hectare of his land. When the test results arrived, they revealed that the soil had high electrical conductivity and lacked essential nutrients like organic carbon, nitrogen, phosphate and boron. The recommended solution included applying 1750 kilograms of compost and cow dung manure per acre, along with specific doses of DAP and urea to improve fertility.\n\"I was hesitant at first,\" he admits. \"Using so much organic input felt like a risk.\" But he trusted the science and followed the recommendations.

The scheme helps farmers understand what their soil needs through regular testing and provides guidance every 2 years. Each card gives farmers a clear picture of the nutrient status of their land. It also suggests the right amount of fertilisers, bio-fertilisers, organic inputs, and soil treatments to help them take better care of their soil over time.\n\nSOIL SAMPLING AND TESTING PROCESS\n\n• Soil samples are taken from a depth of 15–20 cm using a V-shaped cut, collected from four corners"
