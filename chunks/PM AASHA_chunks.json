Oilseeds particularly ground nuts require excessive warehouse space and majority of the oilseeds turn rancid due to accumulation of enzymes and moisture during long storage period. Oilseeds stock requires specialized storage and good inventory management practices which involves higher carryover cost. Further there is very limited potential of usage of oilseeds in welfare schemes as oilseeds needs to be processed before consumption. In addition to this, private sector units in oilseeds space particularly big oil mills have already created storage Spaces which can be used.
