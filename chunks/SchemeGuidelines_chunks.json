Nearly 66% of these units are located in rural areas and about 80% of them are family-based enterprises1. Most of these units falls under category of micro manufacturing units in terms of their investment in plant & machinery and turnover.\n1.1.2 The unorganized food processing industry in India faces challenges that limit its development and weakens performance. These challenges include: (a) lack of productivity and innovation due to limited skills and access to modern technology and machinery for production and packaging; (b) deficient quality and food safety control systems, including lack of basic awareness on good hygienic and manufacturing practices;(c) lack of branding & marketin"
