Overview

5 | P a g e

BACKGROUND The National Development Council (NDC) in its 53rd meeting held on 29th May 2007 adopted a resolution to launch a Food Security Mission comprising Rice, Wheat and Pulses to increase the annual production of Rice by 10 Million Tonnes, Wheat by 8 Million Tonnes and Pulses by 2 Million Tonnes by the end of the Eleventh Plan (2011-12). Accordingly, a Centrally Sponsored Scheme, “National Food Security Mission (NFSM)”, was launched in October-2007. The mission was met with overwhelming success, and the targeted additional production of Rice, Wheat and Pulses was achieved. Based on the experience and performance, the mission was continued and Coarse Cereals (Maize, Barley & Millets) & Commercial Crops (Cotton, Sugarcane & Jute) were included from 2014-15 under NFSM. From 2018-19, NFSM-Coarse Cereals were divided into two parts i.e.
“NFSM-Coarse Cereals (Maize & Barley)” and “Sub-Mission on Nutri-Cereals”.
In the year 2018-19, the Oilseeds & Oil Palm development programmes and the Seed Village Programme were brought under NFSM. After the “National Mission on Edible Oil (NMEO)” launch, the Oilseeds and Oil-palm development programme of NFSM has been subsumed under the NMEO-Oilseeds and NMEO-Oil Palm.
The Millets (Shree Anna) were earlier promoted during 2011-12 to 2013-14 under the programme of “Initiative for Nutritional Security through Intensive Millets Promotion (INSIMP)” as a sub-scheme of RKVY and later merged as component of National Food Security Mission (NFSM) as NFSM-Coarse Cereals from 2014-15. Till 2017-18, NFSM-Coarse Cereals was implemented in 265 districts of 28 states. Based on recommendations of NITI Aayog, a “Sub- Mission on Nutri-Cereals” covering Jowar, Bajra, Ragi and Small millets is being implemented from 2018-19 to provide support to the farmers, consumers in those areas where these crops are traditionally grown and consumed by rural population.
In 12th Five Year Plan under the NFSM, cropping system approach was adopted by including commercial crops like Cotton, Jute and Sugarcane to meet the demand for both Food & Cash crops.
Based on the past experiences & performance Commercial Crops based cropping system component is being continued under NFSNM.
Similarly, a Central Sector Scheme namely “Development and Strengthening of Infrastructure Facilities for Production and Distribution of Quality Seeds” was implemented across the country from the year 2005-06 aiming at ensuring the production and multiplication of high-yielding certified/quality seeds of all crops and making them available to the farmers.
During the XIIth Plan, a “Sub-Mission for Seed and Planting Material (SMSP)” under the National Mission on Agricultural Extension and Technology (NMAET) was rolled-out to make available good quality seeds to the farmers and at affordable prices and in a time-bound manner.
The Sub-Mission has been implemented since 2014-15 and under it, the entire gamut of the seed

6 | P a g e

production chain from the production of nucleus seed to the supply of certified seeds to the farmers, creation of infrastructure conducive to the development of the seed sector, support to the public seed producing organizations for improving their capacity and quality of seed production, create dedicated seed reserve to meet unforeseen circumstances of natural calamities are covered.
Now, based on EFC recommendations, the components of “Sub Mission for Seed and Planting Material (SMSP)” has been merged with the “National Food Security Mission (NFSM)” under Krishonnati Yojana. The cabinet has approved the continuation of the Mission under Krishonnati Yojana till 31.03.2026 and NFSM has been renamed as “National Food Security and Nutrition Mission (NFSNM)”. The NFSNM is now having overall seven components namely: - 1. NFSNM-Rice.
2. NFSNM-Wheat.
3. NFSNM-Pulses.
4. NFSNM-Coarse Cereals (Maize & Barley).
5. NFSNM-Sub Mission on Nutri Cereals (Shree Anna).
6. NFSNM-Commercial Crops.
7. NFSNM-Seed Components (erstwhile Sub-Mission for Seed and Planting Material).
OBJECTIVES The mission is being implemented with the following objectives: - 1. Increasing production of Rice, Wheat, Pulses, Coarse Cereals (Maize & Barley), Commercial Crops (Cotton, Jute & Sugarcane) and Nutri-Cereals (Shree Anna) through area expansion, adoption of different cropping patterns and productivity enhancement in a sustainable manner.
2. Restoring soil fertility and productivity at farm level.
3. Enhancing farm level economy to enhance farmer’s income.
4. Enhancing post-harvest value addition at the farm gate for better price realization to farmers through efficient market linkages.
5. Enhancing the Seed Replacement Rate (SRR) and Varietal Replacement Rate (VRR).
6. Improving the infrastructure of the Seed Sector in the country.
STRATEGY To achieve the above objectives, the mission would adopt the following strategies: - 1. Prioritize districts with low productivity yet high potential, especially focusing on food-grain crops cultivated in rain-fed regions.
2. Implementation of cropping system-centric interventions in a mission mode approach through active engagement of all the stakeholders at various levels.

7 | P a g e

3. Agro-climatic zone-wise planning and cluster approach for crop production and productivity enhancement.
4. Focus on Pulses production through the utilization of Rice Fallow, Rice Bunds and intercropping of Pulses with Coarse Cereals, Oilseeds and Commercial Crops (Sugarcane, Cotton & Jute).
5. Promotion and extension of improved technologies i.e., Seeds, Integrated Nutrient Management (INM) including Micronutrients, Soil Amendments, Integrated Pest Management (IPM), input use efficiency and resource conservation technologies along-with the capacity building.
6. Focus on the incorporation of seeds newly released and notified high-yielding, climate- resilient, bio-fortified, resistant to insect, pest and diseases, short and medium duration varieties in the seed chain.
7. Enhancement of infrastructure facilities in the Seed Sector.
8. Integration of various interventions and targets in the plan of each district identified by State/UT.

MECHANISM OF FUND FLOW & FUNDING PATTERN

The funds for implementing the Mission's programme will be released to the State/UT governments after approval of Annual Action Plan by State Level Sanctioning Committee (SLSC)
headed by Chief Secretary of concerned State/UT. The release of Central Share to the States and UTs would be as per the extant guidelines of DA&FW, MoA&FW and Department of Expenditure, Ministry of Finance, GoI. The Nodal Department will be responsible for submission of all the documents related to physical, financial progress and utilization of funds.
The funding pattern which was restructured in the year 2015-16 will continue for all the components of the mission. The details of which is given below:
i.
60:40 between Central & States for General States.

12 | P a g e

ii.
90:10 between Central & States for North Eastern States (including the J&K, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand).
iii.
100:0 between Central & UTs and Central/National Level Government Agencies.
iv.
If a specific funding pattern is recommended for any component or sub-component of the mission, it will be explicitly stated within that respective component or sub-component.
ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES The Administrative, Monitoring and Evaluation expenses (including payments to PMU/PMT)
will be only 2.5% of the total allocation. The States/UTs may use upto 2.5% of its total annual allocation (Central Share + State Share) for these expenses.
PROCEDURE FOR APPROVAL AND IMPLEMENTATION The DA&FW, MoA&FW, GoI, will communicate the tentative annual outlay to each State and UT for preparing the Annual Action Plan (AAP). At the district level, DFSNM-EC will prepare the AAP, considering local priorities, requirements and potential, and submit it to the State’s Mission Director. Subsequently, the State Mission Director will consolidate the District Action Plans to prepare the Annual Action Plan of State/UT.
The Mission Director of State/UT will get the consolidated AAP approved from the State Food Security & Nutrition Mission-Executive Committee (SFSNM-EC) and present it in the prescribed format to DA&FW, MoA&FW, GoI for comments. The Mission Director will incorporate all the comments/suggestions and submit the AAP to State Level Sanctioning Committee (SLSC), chaired by the Chief Secretary for approval. The duly approved AAP along-with the detailed proposal of each component in prescribed format duly signed/stamped by Mission Director will be submitted to DA&FW, MoA&FW, GoI for release of funds.
The SFSNM-EC is authorized to make adjustments to budgetary allocations, up to 20% of the total, based on local needs, with the SLSC’s approval. However, the proportion of funds allocated to various components must remain consistent with the guidelines.
MONITORING MECHANISM The mission aims to establish a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation framework involving multiple implementing agencies and line departments. At the District Level, DFSNM-EC, supported by PMT/PMU, will supervise the monitoring of all mission components. It will meticulously track the physical and financial progress of various mission interventions.
At the State/UT Level, a committee, led by the Mission Director and including representatives from line departments, ICAR Institutes, SAUs, CAUs, Lead Bank, NABARD, KVKs, and Crop

13 | P a g e

Development Directorates (CDDs) under DA&FW, will oversee the monitoring of mission components.
At the National Level, specialized teams will be constituted to evaluate mission activities.
These teams will comprise members from the Crops Division, Seeds Division, CDDs of DA&FW, ICAR Institutes, SAUs, CAUs, and officials from the Department of Agriculture of State/UT.
REPORTING SYSTEM The Mission Director of the Department of Agriculture for each State/UT will oversee the submission of physical and financial progress reports in formats specified by the DA&FW, MoA&FW, GoI. The formats for preparing the annual action plans, as well as physical and financial reports, will also be outlined by the DA&FW. Copies of these reports, submitted by States, UTs, and implementing agencies, are to be shared with the relevant Crop Development Directorates (CDDs)
under DA&FW, MoA&FW, GoI.
Digital tools like Krishi Mapper will play a pivotal role in tracking field-based activities across mission components, such as demonstrations, seed distribution, and infrastructure development.
The Digital Crop Survey (DCS) will record fields where minikits are sown, while in states without DCS, Krishi Mapper will document minikit sowing by farmers. For interventions like seed production, information on beneficiaries, seed quality, source seeds, and sowing locations will be logged on the SATHI portal and app. Utilizing these platforms ensures real-time monitoring, transparency in disbursements, and accountability, ultimately enhancing the mission's effectiveness.
EVALUATION Periodic evaluations will be undertaken to assess the mission's progress in achieving its objectives and implementing the Annual Action Plan. These evaluations will be conducted by the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Economics & Statistics at the State/UT level, as well as by SAUs, CAUs, or ICAR-Institutes.
At the National Level, impact evaluation studies will be carried out during the mission's implementation to determine the effectiveness of its various components. ICT tools, including web- based portals and applications such as Krishi Mapper, SATHI, and Digital Crop Survey (DCS), will play a crucial role in reporting, monitoring, and evaluating the mission's activities.
CRITERIA FOR IDENTIFICATION OF AREAS & BENEFICIARIES In accordance with the decision of the Government of India regarding implementation of Special Component Plan (SCP) for Scheduled Castes and Tribal Sub-Plan (TSP) for Scheduled Tribes, 16 % of the total allocation for SCP and 8 % for TSP will be earmarked. However, States/UTs

14 | P a g e

16 | P a g e

Interventions under NFSNM: Rice, Wheat, Pulses & Coarse Cereals (Maize & Barley)
The interventions under the four components of NFSNM namely Rice, Wheat, Pulses & Coarse Cereals (Maize & Barley) are given below and norms of their financial assistance are summarized in Annexure-II.
1. DEMONSTRATIONS A. Cluster Demonstrations (by Department of Agriculture of States/UTs on Farmer’s Field):
Cluster demonstration serves as an adaptive research approach to display improved package of practices, cutting-edge technologies, or newly released and notified crop varieties or hybrids (less than 10 years old). These demonstrations are facilitated by the Department of Agriculture of respective States/UTs and are carried out on farmers' fields. The primary goal is to raise awareness among farmers and encourage the adoption of innovative agricultural methods.
The cluster demonstration will be organized by keeping following points under consideration: - i.
Field demonstrations showcasing improved packages of practices will be conducted using a cluster approach, either for a cropping system or a sole crop. An illustrative list of crop- specific interventions is provided in Annexure-III to assist States/UTs in selecting interventions suited to their specific agro-climatic zones for these demonstrations.
ii.
For the "Cropping System-Based Approach" demonstrations will be carried out in a cropping sequence on the same plot of land. States/UTs may organize upto 30% of their demonstrations under this cropping system-based approach.
iii.
The varieties to be included in the package should be newly released and notified high- yielding, climate-resilient, bio-fortified varieties, resistant to insect, pest and diseases (that are less than 10 years old) and better performing than the existing prominent varieties of that area where the demonstration is to be conducted. The seed of such varieties shall be certified seed.
iv.
Area of Operation:
a. Priority should be given to areas with the lowest productivity in the selected districts.
b. For Normal States, the cluster size will be 10 Hectares, while for Hilly States, North- Eastern States, and UTs, it will be 2 Hectares.
c. Each farmer should contribute at least 0.40 Hectare but not exceed 2.00 Hectares of land for the demonstration in a cluster.

17 | P a g e

d. The demonstrations will be conducted in a contiguous block, where the fields will be divided into two sections: one showcasing improved package of practice and the other reflecting the farmer's existing practices, all within the designated cluster.
e. Efforts should be made to evenly distribute the demonstrations among the selected farmers of a cluster uniformly.
f. The State/UT shall ensure that same farmers shall not be repeated in a cluster for at least two years.
g. Each demonstration cluster may highlight a single set of improved packages of practices for a specific crop under the mission, as planned by the State/UT. These clusters should be designed to enable farmers from at least five nearby villages to visit and learn from the demonstration. For subsequent clusters showcasing the same package of practices, a similar strategy should be employed to ensure uniform distribution across the district, thereby enhancing outreach and learning opportunities.
h. For other packages of practices, whether for the same crop or different ones under the mission, additional clusters should be established while adhering to these principles.
The State/UT must ensure that a particular set of packages of practices, once demonstrated through a cluster, is not repeated thereafter.
i. In a district of a State/UT, the types of demonstrations showcasing improved set of packages and practices in a cluster shall be limited to 2-3 types per season. This approach is intended to ensure that farmers can easily comprehend and adopt the showcased technologies.
v.
Selection of Site: The demonstration site should be easily accessible for the farmers, extension workers & scientists. It should not be on an isolated field. The selected site should be the representative of soil type and soil fertility status of the area.
vi.
Soil Analysis: As far as possible soil fertility status of the selected field should be known well in advance for deciding the use of fertilizer and soil ameliorants on the basis of soil health cards. A Soil Health Card is mandatory for the beneficiary of the demonstration.
vii.
Identification of Technologies to be demonstrated: The improved set of packages of practices for the demonstration plots should be determined in collaboration with SAUs (State Agricultural Universities), CAUs (Central Agricultural Universities), Regional Research Stations, KVKs (Krishi Vigyan Kendras), and ICAR (Indian Council of Agricultural Research) Institutes located in the respective area. Priority should be given to the most critical inputs to ensure the effectiveness and success of the demonstrations.

18 | P a g e

viii.
It should be ensured that the type of Block Demonstration done by State/UT shall not over repeat the same activity being under taken CFLDs by KVKs or in FLDs by ICAR-institutes in the district of the State/UT in same season.
ix.
Development of package of inputs to be distributed:
a. Once the technologies are identified, a package of inputs, including micro-nutrients and bio-fertilizers, should be finalized, specifying which inputs are to be provided for conducting the demonstrations. Additionally, the contributions expected from the beneficiary farmers (if required) should also be evaluated.
b. Chemical fertilizers are not permitted as inputs. However, Fertilizer Control Order (FCO) approved Nano-Fertilizers may be incorporated as critical inputs in the cafeteria of demonstrations, following the package of practices recommended by SAUs/CAUs/ICAR. This includes specifications such as the recommended dose, stage of application, and method of application for a particular crop in the state.
Cafeterias for demonstrations under NFSNM, including Nano-Fertilizers, must be reviewed and approved by SAUs/CAUs/ICAR in the respective State/UT.
c. The "Drone Didis" should be engaged for tasks such as IPM (Integrated Pest Management), INM (Integrated Nutrient Management), and Nano-Fertilizer applications.

2. NEED BASED INPUTS (SEED, INM & IPM)
A. Enhancing Breeder Seed Production for increasing indigenous production of Nutri- Cereals in India i.
Breeder’s seed serves as the foundational link in the seed-multiplication program.
Strengthening the program’s efficiency and effectiveness demands meticulous attention.
Therefore, it is crucial to allocate adequate funds and exercise extra care in the breeder seed multiplication process.
ii.
In addition to providing necessary inputs, breeders must ensure proper execution of essential operations such as pollination, isolation, rouging, and processing before the seed is deemed suitable for subsequent multiplication stages.
iii.
The project outlines centre-wise breeder seed production targets for various millets through SAUs, CAUs, ICAR-Institutes, and ICRISAT. The proposed budget for each centre is primarily allocated for infrastructure, seed processing units, and farm equipment.

Three commodity-specific national demonstration-cum-training centers were established under the “Initiative for Nutritional Security through Intensive Millets Promotion (INSIMP)” program at:
i.
The Indian Institute of Millets Research (IIMR), Hyderabad, for Sorghum (formerly Directorate of Sorghum Research, DSR), ii.
The University of Agricultural Sciences (UAS), Bengaluru, for Finger Millet and Small Millets, and iii.
CCS Haryana Agricultural University, Hisar, for Pearl Millet.
These centres, functioning as Centres of Excellence (CoEs) for their designated crops, will be further strengthened with the following objectives:
i.
Developing value-added products, technologies, and recipes.
ii.
Enhancing shelf-life and conducting nutritional profiling.
iii.
Refining technologies, retrofitting machinery, and demonstrating their use.
iv.
Offering entrepreneurship development and training through incubation programs.
v.
Facilitating market linkages between processors and producers.
vi.
Upscaling technologies to drive demand for millets.

36 | P a g e

vii.
Promoting awareness about the nutritional benefits of millets.
The CoEs have made significant contributions to technology development, demonstrations, and capacity-building initiatives for farmers and entrepreneurs. The IIMR has led extensive research in post-harvest value addition, creating a roadmap to boost millet demand and enhance farmers’ income.
Under the Nutri-cereals component of the NFSNM, it is proposed to support these existing CoEs further. They will continue focusing on post-harvest value addition research, particularly in:
i.
Upscaling and commercializing technologies (with an emphasis on entrepreneurship), ii.
Developing entrepreneurship programs with a focus on women, iii.
Conducting shelf-life studies, and iv.
Advancing bio-fortification in millets.
The CoEs will also be tasked with establishing pilot millet kitchens and will receive a one- time grant to support this. Additionally, a mobile exhibition-cum-kitchen will be provided to propagate millet awareness and outreach efforts.
Furthermore, it is proposed that ICAR-IIMR, Hyderabad, will host a Nutri-cereals industrial applications pilot project, focusing on areas such as brewing, biofuels, fodder briquetting, and pellet machinery.
8. AWARENESS, PUBLICITY AND PROMOTION A. Fairs, Exhibitions, Fests and Campaigns i.
State and district-level farmer fairs and exhibitions play a vital role in raising awareness about the significance of millets, improved technologies, high-yielding varieties, and advanced cultivation practices. They also provide an avenue to highlight government initiatives and support aimed at promoting millet production in the country.
ii.
National and State-Level Millets Fests can showcase processing technologies, value addition, and the nutritional advantages of millets, thereby fostering demand for millet-based products. These fests would also encourage private investments in millet processing at the national level. Such investments in value addition can streamline supply chains and motivate more farmers to adopt millet cultivation, leading to increased incomes, improved nutritional security, and sustainable livelihoods for millet producers.
iii.
A nationwide ‘Eat Millets Campaign’ can boost awareness about the benefits of millets, engaging larger consumer groups and creating a strong demand, which in turn will encourage higher millet production.

37 | P a g e

iv.
The campaign could include TV advertisements, publications, documentary films, rural outreach through vans, and unique initiatives like providing millet kitchen carts to unemployed youth. Additionally, it can feature nutritional booklets, mother and childcare guides, recipe collections, exhibitions, seminars, and cultural events to propagate the importance of millets.
B. Road Shows and Millet campaign Rath with Kitchen i.
Roadshows in major cities such as Bangalore, Hyderabad, Chennai, Mumbai, and New Delhi aim to bring together farmers, agri-entrepreneurs, retailers, consumers, and government bodies. These events will promote smart foods, enhancing commodity demand and boosting farmers' incomes in the medium to long term.
ii.
As part of a pilot project under NFSNM, it is proposed to launch 10 Millet Campaign Raths (modified vans equipped with kitchens).
iii.
The Nutri-cereals component will facilitate the organization of these roadshows in the specified cities.
C. Promotion of Millet Restaurants at State and Central Government Offices i.
It is proposed that central and state governments promote the establishment of exclusive millet kitchens within their government offices.
ii.
Unemployed youth, entrepreneurs, and others will be encouraged to undertake such initiatives, with incentives provided under the NFSNM program to support these efforts.

Intervention under NFSNM:
Commercial Crops

39 | P a g e

OBJECTIVE Cotton, Jute, and Sugarcane are among India’s prominent cash crops, cultivated in combination with food crops under diverse agro-climatic conditions. The inclusion of a Commercial Crops component under NFSNM is primarily aimed at enhancing the production of food grains and oilseeds through a cropping system approach, rather than focusing solely on commercial crop production.
This component will be implemented by the Department of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare (DA&FW) in collaboration with the State Department of Agriculture, the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), and other relevant entities. The Crop Development Directorates (CDDs), namely:
i.
The Directorate of Cotton Development (DOCD), Nagpur, ii.
The Directorate of Jute Development (DOJD), Kolkata, and, iii.
The Directorate of Sugarcane Development (DOSD), Lucknow, will serve as nodal offices for their respective crops.
The primary objectives of incorporating a commercial crop-based cropping system include:
1. Utilizing vacant inter-row spaces of commercial crops to grow oilseeds, pulses, etc.
2. Achieving higher net returns and maximizing the cultivable land utilization index compared to mono-cropping.
3. Enhancing soil fertility through appropriate crop rotation with commercial crops.
4. Reducing pest loads by adopting Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategies within the cropping system.
5. Demonstrating advanced technologies for crop utilization, intercropping, and seed production.
6. Addressing recent priorities and implementing need-based interventions for cotton, jute, and sugarcane cultivation.
IMPLEMENTING AGENCIES The programme will be implemented in 19 States as covered during 12th Plan. Beside States, ICAR-Institutes, Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs), State Agriculture Universities (SAUs), Central Agriculture Universities (SAUs), will implement the activities of NFSNM-Commercial Crops. The General Council can however decide the inclusion/exclusion of the states under NFSNM-CC. The following states are there under different commercial crops: - i.
Under NFSNM-Cotton: All the major, traditional & non-traditional states viz., Assam, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Orissa, Punjab,

40 | P a g e

Rajasthan, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh & West Bengal (15 States) are covered. Any new potential state with an area more than 1 lakh ha may be considered as per discretion of General Council.
ii.
Under NFSNM-Jute & Allied Fibres: All the major Eastern & North eastern States viz., Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Orissa, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh & West Bengal (9 States) are covered. Any new potential State with an area more than 10,000 ha may be considered as per discretion of General Council.
iii.
Under NFSNM-Sugarcane: All the major States viz., Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Haryana, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Orissa, Punjab, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Uttarakhand & Uttar Pradesh (13 States) are covered. Any new potential State with an area more than 50,000 ha may be considered as per discretion of General Council. As sugarcane is a water guzzling crop and the depletion of ground water has been a cause of concern, therefore, General Council may consider the states justification provided the state promote sugarcane in the area where irrigation water is not constraint and will promote sugarcane under drip irrigation system only.
The 19 States covered under NFSM-Commercial Crops will have flexibility to include districts where these commercial crops are grown in major area with the approval of SFSNM-EC.

Intervention under NFSNM: Seed Components (erstwhile Sub-Mission for Seed and Planting Material)

52 | P a g e

Interventions under NFSNM: Seed Components The interventions under the NFSNM: Seed Components are given below.
1. FREIGHT CHARGES FOR SEED TRANSPORTATION OBJECTIVE It is one of the component of erstwhile Sub Mission for Seed and Planting Material (SMSP)
under National Mission on Agricultural Extension and Technology (NMAET) and earlier called as Transport Subsidy on Movement of Seeds. The component is important for the North-Eastern States (including Sikkim), J&K, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Hilly areas of West Bengal, as the topographic and the climatic conditions are not conducive for seed production and generally seed is procured from outside for these States. Due to hilly and difficult terrain in these States the cost of seed transportation is more in comparison to movement of seeds in plains. This transportation cost is ultimately added in seed cost and levied from farmers thus making the seed costlier.
Therefore, to reduce the cost of seed to be made available to the farmers of above-mentioned states, the component is continued in the “National Food Security and Nutritional Mission (NFSNM) under Krishionnati Yojana (KY)” with slight modification.
The name of the component has been revised to “Freight Charges for Seed Transportation” with 100% assistance from Government of India to the implementing agencies working in these States or outside the States and supplying Certified Seeds in these States.
Components & Pattern of Assistance i.
Movement of seeds from outside the State for distribution in these States (100% GoI):
The difference between road and rail transportation charges will be reimbursed to the implementing agency for supplying seeds in these states.
ii.
Movement of seeds within the State from Seed Processing Plants/Godowns/Stores located in State Capital/ District/ Tehsil/ Blocks to Sale points (100% GoI): Actual transportation cost or maximum upto Rs. 150 per quintal (whichever is less) for movement of seeds within the state from Seed Processing Plants/Godowns/Stores located in State Capital/District/Tehsil/ Blocks to Sale points will be reimbursed to Implementing Agencies.
Implementing Agencies i.
Department of Agriculture and Horticulture, State Seed Corporations, National Seeds Corporation (NSC) and other National Level Agencies working in field of seed such as NAFED, IFFDC, KRIBHCO, HIL, NFL and BBSSL are eligible for financial assistance under this component.

53 | P a g e

ASSISTANCE FOR FOSTERING SEEDS OF NEW VARIETIES OBJECTIVE Seed is one of the vital input that governs the production and yield of the crop, so it is of foremost importance to make available best quality seed for bumper production and ensuring food security of the nation. The good quality seed in itself can improve the crop productivity from 15-20%.
In country like India, farmers are still using their farm saved seeds for sowing their crop. To improve the quality of farm saved seed the department was implementing a component under erstwhile SMSP namely “Seed Village Program” so that the farmers can improve the quality of their farm saved seed in Cereals, Pulses, Oilseeds, Fodder Crops and Green Manures. Similarly, in another component namely “Certified Seed Production Through Seed Village” under erstwhile SMSP was implemented by the department for promoting the production of certified seed in Pulses, Oilseeds, Fodder and Green Manure.
Now, for giving impetus on the objective of improving the Seed Replacement Rate (SRR) and Varietal Replacement Rate (VRR) a new, revised and comprehensive scheme is needed. Similarly, a lot of research and development work is being carried out by ICAR, SAUs, CAUs and other organizations for development of new and high yielding varieties which are bio-fortified and climate resilient. The rate of incorporation of these varieties in the seed chain has to be expedited and the old varieties needs to be phased-out. One of the important reasons for this was lack of awareness of new varieties, reluctance of farmers to leave old varieties and high cost of breeder seed. A considerable work has been done in last 4-5 years to improve the awareness among different stakeholders about the newly released varieties, but still the cost of breeder seed was one of the biggest factors that impedes the pace of dissemination of new varieties in seed chain. Keeping in view the above factors a new component namely “Assistance for Fostering Seeds of New Varieties” is formulated that has subsumed the earlier “Seed Village Program” and “Certified Seed Production through Seed Village”. Along-with support on the cost of Foundation and Certified seeds, assistance on the cost of breeder seeds of newly released varieties is also available.
COMPONENTS & PATTERN OF ASSISTANCE Assistance on Breeder Seeds (100% GoI): For incorporation of seeds of newly released and notified varieties in seed chain the cost of breeder seed is a big factor. The cost of breeder seed is generally high and assistance on the cost of breeder seed of new varieties will give a boost in rapid incorporation of new varieties in seed chain and ultimately improving the Varietal Replacement Rate (VRR). It will further help the implementing agencies to popularize the new varieties and in reducing the cost of foundation seed production.
