Operational Guidelines of SMAM

Operational Guidelines of SMAM SUB-MISSION ON AGRICULTURAL MECHANIZATION OPERATIONAL GUIDELINES 1.0 Introduction (i)
Agricultural land area in the world has limit, but the demand for food is ever increasing due to population growth. To increase productivity in the limited land so as to meet the expanding demand arising from population growth as well as higher income is very important mission.
(ii)
The task assumes greater importance to India, than the rest of the world considering that India accounts for 2.4% of the world’s geographical area and 4% of its water resources, but has to support 17% of the world’s human population and 15% of the livestock.
(iii)
To increase productivity, timely and precise field work is necessary. To make it possible, agricultural machines take an important role.
(iv)
Among the states, farm power availability in Punjab, Haryana, Western Uttar Pradesh and western part of Rajasthan is higher than the National average of 1.84kW/ha. In rest of the country, especially in Eastern and North-East Regions, it is significantly lower which necessities promotion of farm mechanization as a special Mission.
(v)
Sub Mission on Agricultural Mechanization (SMAM) will be implemented in accordance with guidelines described hereunder.
(vi)
The scheme will be implemented in all the states, to promote the usage of farm mechanization and increase the ratio of farm power to cultivable unit area up to 2 kW/ha.
(vii)
SMAM will have Central Sector Schemes under component No.1 & 2. Centrally Sponsored Schemes are covered under component No. 3 to 8 in which Government of India contributes 60% and states contribute 40%. Funding pattern for states of Northern-Estern and Himalayan region, the share of Govt. of India & State Govt. is 90:10.
2.0 Mission Objectives The Mission objectives are as follows:
(i)
Increasing the reach of farm mechanization to small and marginal farmers and to the regions where availability of farm power is low;
(ii)
Promoting ‘Custom Hiring Centres’ to offset the adverse economies of scale arising due to small landholding and high cost of individual ownership;
(iii)
Creating hubs for hi-tech & high value farm equipments;
(iv)
Creating awareness among stakeholders through demonstration and capacity building activities;
(v)
Ensuring performance testing and certification at designated testing centers located all over the country.
3.0 Mission Strategy To achieve the above objectives, the Mission will adopt the following strategies:
(i)
Conduct performance testing for various farm machineries and equipments at the four Farm

Machinery Training and Testing Institutes (FMTTIs), designated State Agricultural Universities (SAUs) and ICAR institutions;
(ii)
Promote farm mechanization among stakeholders by way of on-field and off-field training and demonstrations.
(iii)
Provide financial assistance to farmers for procurement of farm machinery and implements (iv)
Establish custom hiring centres location and crop specific farm machinery and implements (v)
Provide financial assistance to small and marginal farmers for hiring machinery and implements in low mechanized regions.

V.
MOUNTING STRUCTURERS and TRACKING SYSTEM

The PV modules should be mounted on metallic structures of adequate strength and appropriate design, which can withstand load of modules and high wind velocities up to 150 km per hour. The support structure used in the pumping system should be hot dip galvanized iron with minimum 80 micron thickness.

To enhance the performance of SPV water pumping systems, manual or passive or auto tracking system must be used. For manual tracking, arrangement for seasonal tilt angle adjustment and three times manual tracking in a day should be provided.
